= ENDPOINT-ADD(1)

== NAME

endpoint-add - Create a logical endpoint 

== SYNOPSIS

.BI endpoint-add " name"
.BI "[-p " "server" " [-s " subject "]]"
.br 
.BI endpoint-add " name " --gc

== DESCRIPTION

*endpoint-add *
creates a logical endpoint with a user specified name.  
*endpoint-add*
can also add a physical server to an existing logical endpoint if the 
*-p*
option is given.

If the 
.B
--gc 
option is used, endpoint-add will print a setup key that can be used to install Globus Connect.

A logical endpoint can be used by the
.BR scp " and " transfer
commands to transfer files.  Use the 
.B
endpoint-activate
command to assign a valid credential to an endpoint.

A logical endpoint name may contain these characters: letters, numbers, '.', '-', and '_'.  The first character must be a letter or number.  Endpoint names are case sensitive.


== OPTIONS

.TP
.BI -p " server"
'server '
is a URL or hostname of a file server.  If a hostname is given, the scheme is assumed to be gsiftp://.  The currently supported schemes are ftp:// and gsiftp://.

.TP
.BI -s " subject"
The subject DN that the server's host certificate must present.  Specify this if the server's subject can not be inferred from its DNS name.

.TP
.BI --gc 
Create a Globus Connect endpoint and print a setup key.  The setup key is used to finalize installation of the Globus Connect client software.

== EXAMPLES

.TP
Create a logical endpoint called 'my_endpoint', specifying the scheme, port, and subject:
.ad l
*endpoint-add -p gsiftp://gridftp2.com:1234 -s '/O=Grid/OU=GlobusTest/CN=gridftp2.com' my_endpoint*

.TP
Create a Globus Connect endpoint called 'laptop' and receive a setup key:
*endpoint-add --gc laptop*

== EXIT STATUS

*endpoint-add*
fails if the logical endpoint already exists and no server was specified.  If a server was specified, 
**
endpoint-add
fails if that server has already been added to the logical endpoint.
