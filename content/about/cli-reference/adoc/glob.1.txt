= GLOB(7)

== NAME

glob - Globbing pathnames

== DESCRIPTION

Certain CLI commands, like 
*rm*
and
.BR ls ,
will expand a shell-compatibile glob pattern in the final path component.
For example, \(aqrm go#ep1/tmp/*.txt\(aq would look for all files in /tmp that
match \(aq*.txt\(aq.  


== DETAILS

The rules below are standard POSIX.

A string is a wildcard pattern if it contains one of the
characters \(aq?\(aq, \(aq*\(aq or \(aq[\(aq.
Globbing is the operation
that expands a wildcard pattern into the list of pathnames
matching the pattern.
Matching is defined by:

A \(aq?\(aq (not between brackets) matches any single character.

A \(aq*\(aq (not between brackets) matches any string,
including the empty string.

.PP
*"Character classes"*
.sp
An expression "\fI[...]\fP" where the first character after the
leading \(aq[\(aq is not an \(aq!\(aq matches a single character,
namely any of the characters enclosed by the brackets.
The string enclosed by the brackets cannot be empty;
therefore \(aq]\(aq can be allowed between the brackets, provided
that it is the first character.
(Thus, "\fI[][!]\fP" matches the
three characters \(aq[\(aq, \(aq]\(aq and \(aq!\(aq.)
.PP
*Ranges*
.sp
There is one special convention:
two characters separated by \(aq\-\(aq denote a range.
(Thus, "\fI[A\-Fa\-f0\-9]\fP"
is equivalent to "\fI[ABCDEFabcdef0123456789]\fP".)
One may include \(aq\-\(aq in its literal meaning by making it the
first or last character between the brackets.
Thus, "\fI[]\-]\fP" matches just the two characters \(aq]\(aq and \(aq\-\(aq.
.PP

*Complementation*
.sp
An expression "\fI[!...]\fP" matches a single character, namely
any character that is not matched by the expression obtained
by removing the first \(aq!\(aq from it.
(Thus, "\fI[!]a\-]\fP" matches any
single character except \(aq]\(aq, \(aqa\(aq and \(aq\-\(aq.)

One can remove the special meaning of \(aq?\(aq, \(aq*\(aq and \(aq[\(aq by
preceding them by a backslash or enclosing enclosing them in quotes.
Between brackets these characters stand for themselves.

*NOTE: *
The Globus Online CLI shell also performs a level of backslash
interpretation, so one must double up a backslash to send it to a command.  For
example: 

.nf
   ls go#ep1/tmp/\\\\*.txt

would require a file with a literal asterisk in its name.
