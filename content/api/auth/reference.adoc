:toc:
:numbered:
:toc-placement: manual

The Globus Auth API has a set of common conventions that it uses
throughout, as described in the following subsections.

'''
toc::[]

== Base URL

All Globus Auth API interactions are
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.6[TLS-secured] with the host auth.globus.org.
Therefore, URLs to Globus Auth resources begin with https://auth.globus.org/.

== Versioning

All public Globus Auth resource URL paths are prefixed by `/v2/`. For
example:

    GET https://auth.globus.org/v2/api/identities/2982f207-04c0-11e5-ac60-22000b92c6ec

Globus Auth API clients can assume the syntax and semantics of the
resourcesÂ defined in this specification will not change in an
incompatible manner. However, the resources may be extended, as long as
such extensions are backward compatible. For example:

* The Globus Auth API may be extended with additional resources.
* Resource URLs may be extended to support additional query parameters.
* JSON documents used by resource requests and responses may contain
additional fields. Clients should ignore any fields they do not
recognize.

Clients SHOULD NOT use Globus Auth resource URL paths that are prefixed by
`/p/`, as these are private, internal resources that may change at any
time without warning.

(Globus Auth Version 1 was an API known as "Globus Nexus" or "Globus
Graph", which was only available for select uses outside Globus.)

== Authorization

=== Overview

All applications follow a basic pattern when accessing Globus-enabled resources
using OAuth 2.0.

At a high level, you'll need to follow four steps:

[qanda]
Register your app to receive credentials.::

Visit the Client Registration Page to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials such as a client ID and client secret that are used to identify your application to
Globus Auth.

Obtain one or more access tokens from Globus Auth::

Before your application can access private data on a Globus-enabled resource
server, it must obtain an `access token` that grants access to those resources. A
single access token is valid for a particular resource server's API, but it
can grant varying degrees of access to  APIs. A variable parameter called
`scope` controls the set of resources and operations that an access token
permits. During the access-token request, your
application sends one or more values in the scope parameter.  There are
several ways to make this request, and they vary based on the type of
application you are building. For example, a JavaScript application might
request an access token using a browser redirect, while an
application installed on a device that has no browser uses direct HTTP requests.
Some requests require an authentication step where the user logs in to Globus
Auth using one of their `identities`. After logging in, the user is asked whether they
are willing to grant the permissions that your application is requesting. This
process is called user consent.  If the user grants the permission, Globus Auth
sends your application an access token (or an
authorization code that your application can use to obtain an access token).
If the user does not grant the permission, the server returns an error.  It is
generally a best practice to request the minimum scopes your application needs
to properly function.

Send the access token to an API.::

After an application obtains an access token, it sends the token to a
resource server API in an HTTP authorization header. Access tokens are
valid only for a particular resource server and the set of operations and
resources described in the scope of the token request. For example, if an access
token is issued for the Globus Transfer API, it does not grant access to the
XSEDE User Profile API. You can, however,send the same access token to a
resource server multiple times for similar operations.

Refresh the access token, if necessary.::

Access tokens have limited lifetimes. If your application needs access to a
resource server beyond the lifetime of a single access token, it can obtain a
refresh token. A refresh token allows your application to obtain new access
tokens.

=== Obtaining authorization - Supported OAuth2 Grant Types

Globus Auth Supports the following OAuth2 grant types (detailed below):

* link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1[Authorization Code Grant] (Most secure, **preferred**)
* Dependent Token Grant (Custom extension grant, used by resource servers)
* link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3[Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant] (Required by certain non web-based clients)
* link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2[Implicit Grant] (Limited to specific, trusted apps)

These grants all share the same HTTP endpoints:

**Authorization:** https://auth.globus.org/v2/oauth2/authorization

**Token:** https://auth.globus.org/v2/oauth2/token

=== Authorization Code Grant (preferred)

link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1[Authorization Code Grant]: For obtaining an access token, via
browser redirection, for a web server-based client to access a resource server.

**Preparing to start the OAuth 2.0 flow**

You will need:

- The client_id and client_secret from your client registration.

- The scopes your client is requesting.

**Redirecting the user to the OAuth 2.0 server**

Construct a URL for the OAuth2 authorization endpoint `https://auth.globus.org/v2/oauth2/authorization` with the following parameters:

[options="header"]
|==================
|Parameter |Values |Description
|response_type| `code`| Determines whether Globus Auth returns an authorization code. For the authorization code grant, this value is always `code`
|client_id| The client ID you obtained when registering your client.| Identifies the client that is making the request.
The value passed in this parameter must exactly match the value issued for your client on  registration.
|redirect_uri| One of the redirect_uri values you registered for your client.| Determines where the response is sent.
The value of this parameter must exactly match one of the values listed for this client in the registration system. (including the http or https scheme, case, and trailing '/').
|scope| Space-delimited set of permissions that the application requests.| Identifies the access that your application is requesting.
The values passed in this parameter inform the consent screen that is shown to the user and the number of access tokens returned.
|state| Any string| Provides any state that might be useful to your application upon receipt of the response.
Whatever value you send here will be returned to your application unmodified. To mitigate against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), it
is strongly recommended to include an anti-forgery token in the state, and confirm it in the response. link:http://www.thread-safe.com/2014/05/the-correct-use-of-state-parameter-in.html[See here] for further suggestions on how to use the state parameter.
|access_type| online or offline| Indicates whether your application needs to access resources when the user is not present at the browser.
If access_type is offline, your application will be issued a refresh token along with the access token the first time it exchanges an authorization code for a token.
|===================

An example URL is shown below, with line breaks and spaces for readability.

 https://auth.globus.org/v2/oauth2/authorization?
   scope=urn%3Aglobus%3Aauth%3Ascope%3Aauth.globus.org%3Aview_identities+openid+email+profile
   state=security_token%3D138r5719ru3e1%26url%3Dhttps://oa2cb.example.com/myHome&
   redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foauth2-login-demo.example.com%2Fcallback&,
   response_type=code&
   client_id=d430e6c8-b06f-4446-a060-2b6b2bc3e54a

After you create the request URL, redirect the user to it.

**Handling the OAuth 2.0 server response**

The OAuth 2.0 server responds to your application's access request by redirecting the user's browser
to the `redirect_uri` specified in the request.

If the user approves the access request, then the response contains an authorization code.
If the user does not approve the request, the response contains an error message.
All responses are returned to your application on the query string, as shown below:

An error response:

`https://oauth2-login-demo.example.com/callback?error=access_denied`

A successful authorization code response:

`https://oauth2-login-demo.example.com/callback?code=P7q7W91a-oMsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7`

IMPORTANT: If your response endpoint renders an HTML page, any resources on that page will be able to see the authorization
code in the URL. Scripts can read the URL directly, and all resources may be sent the URL in the Referer HTTP header.
Carefully consider if you want to send authorization credentials to all resources on that page (especially
third-party scripts such as social plugins and analytics). To avoid this issue, we recommend that the server
first handle the request, then redirect to another URL that doesn't include the response parameters.

After the web server receives the authorization code, it can exchange the authorization code for one or more access tokens.

To exchange an authorization code for an access token, POST to the `https://auth.globus.org/v2/oauth2/token` endpoint, with
an Authorization header containing an HTTP Basic Auth header for your client_id and client_secret, and including the
following field:

[options="header"]
|============
|Field | Description
|code | The authorization code returned from the previous authorization request.
|redirect_uri | The same value you sent in the previous authorization request.
|grant_type | As defined in the OAuth 2.0 specification, this field must contain a value of `authorization_code`.
|=============

The actual request might look like the following:

    POST /v2/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: auth.globus.org
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Authorization: Basic NDFjYTIwM2QtNzcwMy00NDYxLWFiNGItNjVhNjA0YjE2NjE5OjxDTElFTlRfU0VDUkVUPg==

    code=P7q7W91a-oMsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7&
    redirect_uri=https://oauth2-login-demo.example.com/callback&
    grant_type=authorization_code

A successful response to this request contains the following fields:

[options="header"]
|==========
|Field | Description
|access_token | The token that can be used to access resources.
|scope | Space-separated list of scopes the access token authorizes.
|resource_server | The resource server for which the access_token token is intended.
|expires_in | The remaining lifetime of the access token.
|token_type | Identifies the type of token returned. At this time, this field
will always have the value bearer.
|refresh_token | A token that may be used to obtain a new access token. Refresh
tokens are valid until the user revokes access. This field is only present if
the authorization request asked for offline access.
|id_token | A JWT containing details about the user as defined in the
link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[OpenIDConnect specification.]
Note: Currently, this field is always included by default, but soon it will only be present if the
'openid' scope was requested during the authorization request. If your application requires an id_token
you SHOULD request openid scopes during the authorization request.
|state | The state parameter your client application provided during the authorization request.
|other_tokens | If the client requested scopes that span multiple resource servers, this field will be present, and
it will contain an array of access token responses containing separate tokens for each resource server.
|==========

NOTE: The scope named first in the authorization request (excepting openid scopes)
      will determine the access token returned in the top level of the response object.

A successful response is returned as a JSON object, similar to the following:

    {
        "access_token": "tggaKq69-qJiDRHp5oPW_lllll5syWfZ...",
        "resource_server": "transfer.api.globus.org",

        "other_tokens": [
            {
                "access_token": "E3SfxOvlvsQ49lTn6cA0RGfRXHcwy85q...",
                "resource_server": "auth.globus.org",

                "token_type": "bearer"
            }
        ]
    }

==== Refresh Token Grant

If your application requires access beyond the lifetime of a single access token, it can request
offline access, and then use a refresh token to obtain fresh access tokens. Refresh tokens will
remain valid indefinitely if they are being used, but they expire after six months of inactivity.
They can also be explicitly revoked by a user.

POST request to https://auth.globus.org/v2/oauth2/token, with an HTTP Basic
Authorization header containing your client_id and client_secret.
The request must include the following parameters:

[options="header"]
|=============
|Field | Description
|refresh_token | The refresh token returned from the authorization code exchange.
|grant_type | As defined in the OAuth 2.0 specification, this field must contain a value of refresh_token.
|=============

Such a request will look similar to the following:

    POST /v2/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: auth.globus.org
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Authorization: Basic NDFjYTIwM2QtNzcwMy00NDYxLWFiNGItNjVhNjA0YjE2NjE5OjxDTElFTlRfU0VDUkVUPg==

    refresh_token=6BMfW9j53gdGImsiyUH5kU5RsR4zwI9lUVX-tqf8JXQ&
    grant_type=refresh_token

As long as the refresh_token has not expired or been revoked the response
includes a new access token. A response from such a request is shown below:

    {
      "access_token":"fFBGRNJru1FQd44AzqT3Zg...",
      "refresh_token": "6BMfW9j53gdGImsiyUH5kU5RsR4zwI9lUVX-tqf8JX",
      "expires_in":3920,
      "token_type":"Bearer",
    }

=== Implicit Grant

link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2[Implicit Grant]: For obtaining an access token, via browser
redirection, for a Javascript client running in a browser.

Similar to the Authorization Code grant, except a token is returned directly to the browser.

This flow is not recommended, because it is less secure than the Authorization Code grant.

=== Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3[Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant] : For obtaining an access
token for a non-browser-based client (e.g., command line, mobile, or
desktop application).

NOTE: This feature will only work with certain identity providers that are configured
      to support non-browser-based authentication based on username and password.

=== Verifying identity (via OpenID Connect ID Token)

WARNING: Currently, all OpenID Connect claims are returned in the `id_token` by default, regardless of requested scopes. In the near future, only requested claims will be returned. Your application should request the OpenID Connect scopes it requires.

Globus Auth's OAuth2 grants accept the following OpenID Connect scopes:

* openid: Requests that an OpenID Connect id_token be returned as part
of the
https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749%23section-5.1&sa=D&ust=1459362629124000&usg=AFQjCNGUaPR7rbD_uRrLLMjM6Q-r9dlGxQ[OAuth2
Access Token Response], with the following claims:

** sub: The Globus Auth identity id of the effective identity of the
logged in Globus account. This effective may be the primary identity, or
the appropriate linked identity if this client requires an identity from
a particular provider.
** iss: The URL
"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://auth.api.globus.org&sa=D&ust=1459362629125000&usg=AFQjCNEqtyMLYHS0ZeGw9hPoQjTydW7P8Q[https://]https://www.google.com/url?q=https://auth.api.globus.org&sa=D&ust=1459362629126000&usg=AFQjCNHyBtz4q2_ZNRvmMxFc4Y8QwQu8CA[auth.globus.org]"
** at_hash: Per OpenID Connect specification.
** aud: Per OpenID Connect specification.
** exp: Per OpenID Connect specification.
** iat: Per OpenID Connect specification.
** nonce: Per OpenID Connect specification.

* email: Adds the following claim in the id_token:

** email: The email address associated with the identity provided in the
"sub" claim.

* profile: Adds the following claim in the id_token:

** name: The identity's full name (e.g. Jane Doe) in displayable form.
** preferred_username: The identity username for the effective identity
id provided by the âsub' claim.

These claims are being made by Globus Auth (iss), on behalf of an
identity provider, about an identity (sub, name, email) that has been
provisioned by the identity provider with Globus Auth, and authenticated
by the identity provider via Globus Auth.

In order to verify the signature of the id_token, you can use the our public
keys at https://auth.globus.org/jwk.json

== API Endpoints

Unless otherwise noted, all REST calls are authenticated using the
HTTP Authorization header. Clients will need to include either a
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750[Bearer Token] (i.e. access token)
or link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617[Basic Auth] credentials in the
Authorization header of the request.

Globus Auth will return will return HTTP 401 Unauthorized for any call
that is missing the relevant header information, or if the access token
has expired or been revoked, unless it is specifically noted that the
call requires no authorization or some other form of authorization. It
is recommend that resource owner APIs do the same.

=== Including associated resources ("side-loading")

A resource request can have anÂ "include" query parameter, followed by a
list of fields that specify what associated resources should be included
in the response. For example:

    GET /v2/api/identities/2982f207-04c0-11e5-ac60-22000b92c6ec?include=identity_provider

will respond not just with requested identity resource document, but
also the associated identity_provider resource document.

=== CORS

https://auth.globus.org supports link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[CrossOrigin Resource Sharing (CORS)]
to allow any client to directly access the Globus Auth API.

//URL trailing /
//^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

//A trailing / on a URL path is not significant. Globus Auth will
//interpret URLs with and without a trailing / in the same way.

=== /v2/api/identities resources

Resource type: identity

[cols="default,default,asciidoc",options="header"]
|=============
|Field | Type | Description
|id | UUID
|Globus Auth issued identity id, guaranteed to uniquely identify a single
identity, even if the identity username associated with the identity is
changed or re-used by the identity provider. An id will never be
re-used. *This field is visible to all clients.*
|username|String|The username of the identity.

The identity username is guaranteed to be unique amongst all Globus Auth
identities at any given time. However, since identity providers can
change or re-use usernames the following caveats apply:

* The identity username associated with a given identity id is NOT
guaranteed to remain constant over time.
* A single identity username MAY be associated with different identity
ids over time

If identity category is ssh-public-key, the identity username is the
hash of the public key. (TBD: Define hash algorithm and encoding.)
Otherwise, the identity username is defined by the issuing identity
provider.

*This field is visible to all clients.*

|status | String enum
|One of:

- "unused", indicating that no user has proven ownership of this
identity by authenticating with it. Resource servers may assign
permissions to an unused identity. (See GET /v2/api/identities/<name>.)
- "used", indicating that a user has proven ownership of this identity.
The identity will typically, but not necessarily, be associated with a
Globus Account.
- "private", indicicating that the user has restricted visibility of their
identity.
- "closed", indicating that this identity is no longer valid, typically
because the provider has revoked it and perhaps reused the identity
username. When an identity is closed, it will be removed from all Globus
accounts, and end-users can no longer authenticate with this identity.
Resource servers MAY remove any permissions associated with a closed
identity, though since it is removed from all Globus accounts it will
never be included in a token's identities list, so will never result in
matching a permission.

|email
|String
|Identity provider specified email address for this identity.

This email address may be used by Globus Auth, clients and resource
servers for email notifications related to this identity.

Globus Auth provides no guarantees about the email address, including
whether the email address has been verified, or if emails sent to this
address will be successfully delivered.

|name |String
|Identity provider specified display name (e.g., user's full name) for
this identity.

|organization | String
|The name of the organization this identity is associated with.
This may be set by the provider or, if the provider does not set it, by the user
themselves.
|=======================

=== GET /v2/api/identities/<id>

Responds with an identity resource type document for the identity with
the specified <id>.

The response may not include all fields, depending on the identity's
visibility policy. Â However, the identity id, category, and name fields
are always visible to all clients.

=== GET /v2/api/identities?identity_ids=<list-of-identity-ids>

Returns a list of identity resource type documents for the comma
separated list of identity ids.

If the identity_id does not exist, it is not in the listâ¦

An identity documents may not include all fields, depending on the
identity's visibility policy.

=== GET /v2/api/identities?usernames=<list-of-identity-names>

Returns a list of identity resource type documents for the comma
separated list of identity ids.

WARNING: An identity username must not be used as the unique identifier
for an identity, because an identity provider may reuse an identity
username over time. Clients must always use an identity id as the unique
identifier when persisting an identity in its own records (e.g., in an access
control policy).

If a field in an identity resource is not visible to the client (e.g.,
due to that identity's visibility policy), that field will have a value
of null.

Example request:

    GET /v2/api/identities?usernames=webapptester1%40globusid.org,webapptester2%40globusid.org HTTP/1.1
    Host: auth.globus.org
    Authorization: Bearer A7oU1xJ8-ddvRiMf-ZFDvXb

    }

== API for Resource Servers

Globus Auth provides a set of API resources for use only by resource
providers.

=== Token Introspection (POST /v2/oauth2/token/introspect)

This can only be used by a resource server, authorized using that
resource server's client identifier and client secret.

This resource conforms to the
link:https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662&sa=D&ust=1459362629167000&usg=AFQjCNE4XOZ2Si4HXEsT5HWm_bwUCVKuhw[RFC
7662], OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection.

When a resource server receives a request from a client, it must
validate the access token included in the request (<request access
token>), and learn more information about the authorization granted by
this request access token. The resource server does so by performing an
HTTP POST on /v2/oauth2/token/introspect, with parameters sent as
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" data as defined in
[https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/&sa=D&ust=1459362629169000&usg=AFQjCNFhrPEvarVy18hPhYRTd_T1i2KxPA[W3C.REC-html5-20141028]].

Request parameters are:

[options="header"]
|=============
|Parameter | Description
|token | The request access token on which this request is performing introspection.
|include | Request optional fields be included in the response. Currently the only supported value is `identities_set`, which will include the list of all
identities ids (primary and linked) that are associated with this Globus Auth account.
|============

This request's Authorization header must contain resource server's
client identifier (client_id) and client secret (client_secret) in a

7662]Â compliant JSON document with the following fields:

Resource type: token/introspect

[options="header"]
|=============
|Field | Type | Description
|active | Bool | False if the token has expired or been revoked, true otherwise.
|scope | Space-separated List of Strings | List of scopes to which this access token authorizes access.
|sub | UUID | An effective identity id belonging to the account associated with this access token. This effective identity is either the primary identity of
the account, or if the client requires an identity issued by a
particular identity provider, then it may be the appropriate linked
identity from the account.
|username | String | The identity username for the effective identity id provided by the sub field.
|name | String/null | The display name for the effective identity of this token, typically a
full name. May be null, if the user has restricted their identity
visibility.
|email* | String/null | The email address associated with the effective identity of this token.
May be null, if the user has restricted their identity visibility.
|client_id | UUID | The Globus Auth issued client id of the client toÂ which this token was issued.
|aud | List of strings | Identifier of the audiences for whom this token is intended. This will include both the resource server DNS name
and the client_id of the client to which this token was issued. In order to avoid a 'confused deputy' attack, clients and resource servers SHOULD validate that they are among the intended
audience for a token.
|iss | String | String representing the issuer of this token, which will always be
`https://auth.globus.org`. Note: During the transition from Globus Nexus to Globus Auth, legacy
tokens will have iss set to `https://nexus.api.globusonline.org`.
|exp | Timestamp | Integer timestamp, measured in the number of seconds since January 1 1970 UTC, indicating when this token will expire.
|iat |Timestamp | Integer timestamp, measured in the number of seconds since January 1 1970 UTC, indicating when this token was originally issued.
|nbf | Timestamp |Integer timestamp, measured in the number of seconds since January 1 1970 UTC, indicating when this token is not to be used before.
|identities_set*Â [OPTIONAL] | List of UUIDs | A list of all identities ids (primary and linked) that are associated
with this Globus Auth account, which are visible to this resource
server. For performance reasons, this field is only included when the client
requests it with the parameter include=identities_set in the POST body.
|================

WARNING: Some identity providers reuse identity usernames, so over time
an identity username may map to different identity ids. Clients must use
the identity id as the persistent identifier of an identity.

+++* =+++ Not part of RFC7662, Globus Auth-specific extension fields.

If the <request access token> does not exist, or was issued by Globus
Auth for use with a different resource server, then the HTTP response
will be 401 Unauthorized.

Example request:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â POST /v2/oauth2/token/introspect HTTP/1.1

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Host: auth.globus.org

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â token=A7oU1xJ8-ddvRiMf-ZFDvXb&include=identities_set

Example response:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "active": true,
        "scope": "urn:globus:auth:scope:service.example.com:all",
        "client_id": "d430e6c8-b06f-4446-a060-2b6b2bc3e54a",
        "sub": "2982f207-04c0-11e5-ac60-22000b92c6ec",
        "username": "user1@example.com",
        "aud": "server.example.com",

        "iat": 1419350238,
        "nbf": 1419350238,
        "identities_set": [
            "2982f207-04c0-11e5-ac60-22000b92c6ec",
            "3982f207-04c0-11e5-ac60-22000b92c6ed"
        ],
        "name": "Joe User",
        "email": "user1@example.dom"
    }

NOTE: Globus Auth uses POST rather than GET in accordance with
    RFC7662 because of security concerns with passing an access token as
    part of a URL. An access token is a bearer token, so great care must be
    taken to ensure its confidentiality. However, web servers, proxies, and
    clients routinely log URLs. If URLs contain access tokens, and the logs
    are not properly sanitized or kept sufficiently confidential, they
    become a potential target for an attacker. By using a POST with the
    <request access token> included in the request body, the access token is
    not included in the URL.

=== Dependent Token Grant (POST /v2/oauth2/token)

This can only be used by a resource server, authorized using that
resource server's client identifier and client secret.

When a resource server receives a request from a client, after
validating the access token included in the request (<request access
token>) via link:#h.wh7c5vauquo4[token introspection (POST
/v2/oauth2/token/introspect)], the resource server may need to retrieve
dependent access tokens that allow this resource server to act as a
client to other resource servers on behalf of the client. The resource
server does so by performing a Globus Auth "Dependent Token Grant",
which is an
https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749%23section-4.5&sa=D&ust=1459362629207000&usg=AFQjCNHTauLReWKZtkzxV_PeVBmHsee8Pg[OAuth2
Extension

In conformance with the OAuth2 standard, the resource server does so by
performing an HTTP POST on /v2/oauth2/token, with parameters sent as
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" data as defined in
[https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/&sa=D&ust=1459362629209000&usg=AFQjCNGOpgK7QE_QmvSP_4cw07rvH_oa9A[W3C.REC-html5-20141028]].

Request parameters are:

options="header"]
|=============
|Parameter | Value | Description
|grant_type | `urn:globus:auth:grant_type:dependent_token` | Custom OAuth2 extension grant type
|token | <request access token> | The
|access_type | `online` or `offline` (default: `online`) |
If `offline`, include any refresh tokens to which the resource server is entitled.
Whether or not refresh tokens are included depends on whether the scope policies allow it.
|============

This request's Authorization header must contain resource server's
client identifier (client_id) and client secret (client_secret) in a
base64-encoded "Basic Authorization" scheme.

Example request:

   POST /v2/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Host: auth.globus.org
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Authorization: Basic <Resource Server's Client Credentials>

   grant_type=urn:globus:auth:grant_type:dependent_token&token=A7oU1xJ8-ddvRiMf-ZFDvXb

The response will be a JSON document containing an array of OAuth2
standard
https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749%23section-5.1&sa=D&ust=1459362629212000&usg=AFQjCNHRcoOSgfcymFXxnouwGm5G6KN_Kw[access_token
response documents]. The number of tokens returned and their scopes are
pre-determined by the scope dependencies registered with Globus Auth by
the resource server administrators. The resource server does not have
the ability to request particular scopes when using this grant type.

For example, if the above request was made by the
transfer.api.globus.org resource server upon receipt of a request to its
urn:globus:auth:scope:service.example.com:all scope, and that scope is
configured to require dependent scopes of
urn:globus:auth:scope:groups.api.globus.org:check_membership and
urn:globus:auth:scope:auth.globus.org:view_identities scopes, then an
example response would be:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
