= Globus Auth

Globus Auth provides the following resources intended to be used from
web browsers.

== GET https://auth.globus.org/v2/web/logout

When Â a web application that that uses Globus Auth via a Authorization
Code Grant, after doing whatever cleanup it needs to do (e.g., delete
access tokens), it should redirect the user's web browser to
`https://auth.globus.org/v2/web/logout`.
Globus Auth will delete any authentication cookies it set for the the user, so that
subsequent Authorization Code Grants will require re-authentication with
an identity provider.

To control the behavior of the page, clients can pass the following
query parameters:

* client_id=<client-id>
* redirect_uri=<http-url>
* redirect_name=<link-text>

Passing client_id will make the logout page header "Logged out of
<client-display-name>". For example, if the client display name that was
registered with Globus Auth for the specified <client-id> is "Example
App", the logout page header will be "Logged out of Example App". This
parameter will also apply branding associated with the client, if any.

If redirect_uri and redirect_name parameters are provided, the bottom of
the logout page will display "Continue to <link-text>", which is linked
to <http-url>.

== GET https://auth.globus.org/v2/web/identities

This page displays the authenticated user's identities, including any linkages
that they have established via Globus Auth.

To control the behavior of the page, clients can pass the following
query parameters:

* client_id=<client-id>
* redirect_uri=<http-url>
* redirect_name=<link-text>

Passing client_id will apply branding associated with the client, if any.

If redirect_uri and redirect_name parameters are provided, the top of
the identities page will display "Return to <link-text>", which is linked
to <http-url>.

== GET https://auth.globus.org/v2/web/consents

This page displays the authenticated user's application consents: a list of
applications and the activities that the user has explicitly allowed them to
