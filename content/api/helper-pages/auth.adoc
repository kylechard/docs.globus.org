= Globus Auth

Globus Auth provides the following resources intended to be used from
web browsers.

== GET https://auth.globus.org/v2/web/logout

When Â a web application that that uses Globus Auth via a Authorization
Code Grant, after doing whatever cleanup it needs to do (e.g., delete
access tokens), it should redirect the user's web browser to
`https://auth.globus.org/v2/web/logout`.
Globus Auth will delete any authentication cookies it set for the the user, so that
subsequent Authorization Code Grants will require re-authentication with
an identity provider.

To control the behavior of the page, clients can pass the following
query parameters:

* client_id=<client-id>
* redirect_uri=<http-url>
* redirect_name=<link-text>

Passing client_id will make the logout page header "Logged out of
<client-display-name>". For example, if the client display name that was
registered with Globus Auth for the specified <client-id> is "Example
App", the logout page header will be "Logged out of Example App"

If redirect_uri and redirect_name parameters are provided, the bottom of
the logout page will display "Continue to <link-text>", which is linked
to <http-url>.
