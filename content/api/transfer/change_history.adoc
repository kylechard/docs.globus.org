////
Note: We use asciidoc in some table cells for
1. labeled lists
2. source code (json) blocks.
You need to be careful to not have spaces between the a| and content, 
otherwise it shows up as monospace (?) in asciidoc.py.
Also, using 'a' type cells when not needed makes asciidoc slower; it executes
asciidoc for each cell of type 'a'.

== 5.1

* Endpoint Search
** Add +filter_owner_id+ to replace the deprecated +filter_owner_username+.
   The latter is still supported for now, but clients should migrate.
** Ranking: managed endpoints are ranked higher, miscellaneous improvements.

* Task Management
** Add +owner_id+ field to task document, deprecate +username+.

* Advanced Endpoint Management
** Add +owner_id+ field to task document, deprecate +username+.
** Add +filter_owner_id+ query parameter to +task_list+ resource, and
   deprecate +filter_username+.
** Add +source_local_user+, +source_local_user_status+,
   +destination_local_user+, and +destination_local_user_status+
   to "task" documents.

== 5.0

* Endpoint
** Add +owner_id+ and +owner_string+ fields, deprecate +username+.

* Endpoint Access Rules
** The +id+ field is now a UUID string, instead of an integer id.
** Add 'anonymous' link:../acl#_access_rule_types[principal type]
** Remove 'user' and 'email' principal types, replace with single
   'identity' type.
** Remove 'send_email' option, replace with 'notify_email' and
   'notify_message'

* Endpoint Roles
** Replace 'user' principal type with 'identity' principal type.

* Pause Rules
** Add +identity_id+ and +modified_by_id+ fields; deprecate +username+ and
   +modified_by+.

* New resources
** link:../endpoint#_get_shared_endpoint_list[Get shared endpoint list]

== 4.7

* Endpoint Search
** Change full text search to match on prefix instead of whole word.
** Increase weights of +display_name+, +canonical_name+, and
   +keywords+ for full text result ordering.
** Add search scope 'my-gcp-endpoints'.
** Fix bug preventing utf8 search terms in +filter_fulltext+.

== 4.6

* Endpoint
** Add "EndpointDeleted" error to
   link:../endpoint#get_endpoint_by_id[Get endpoint by id].
* New API: Endpoints Most Recently Used (MRU)
** `GET /endpoint_mru_list?limit=N`, max limit of 100.
** Returns the most recently used
   endpoints for the current user, up to the specified limit, sorted by
   how recently they were used. Currently only submitting a transfer or
   delete tasks to an endpoint counts as 'using' the endpoint.
** Also supports the standard +fields+ query parameter.
** Note that `/endpoint_search?scope=recently-used` is still sorted by
   endpoint name, not by how recently each endpoint was used.
** This API is *alpha* and is likely to change in the near future.

== 4.5

* New link:../endpoint_search[Endpoint Search] API (this
  was actually added in 4.4 but was incomplete).

* Endpoint
** Add +gcp_connected+ and +gcp_paused+ to
   link:../endpoint#_endpoint_document[endpoint document].
** Fix backward incompatible change in 4.4 causing an error when +myproxy_dn+
   is set to an empty string. It is now mapped to null in endpoint update,
   but clients are still encouraged to send null and not empty string.

* Task
** Add +files_transferred+
   to link:../task#_task_document[task document].

== 4.4

* New link:../endpoint_bookmarks[Endpoint Bookmarks] API.

* Endpoint
** Add +id+ and +host_endpoint_id+,
   +display_name+, +host_endpoint_display_name+, +subscription_id+,
   +contact_info+, +contact_email+, +info_link+, +organization+,
   +departement+, and +keywords+, +network_use+, +location+,
   +subscription_id+, +min_concurrency+, +preferred_concurrency+,
   +min_parallelism+, +preferred_parallelism+
   to link:../endpoint#_endpoint_document[endpoint document].
** All resources with an endpoint param in URI can now take an id. Using
   a canonical name is still supported but is deprecated.
** Add +id+ field to endpoint and shared endpoint create result documents.

* Transfer and Delete
** The +source_endpoint+ and +destination_endpoint+ fields can be id in
   addition to canonical names. Using canonical name will be deprecated
   and eventually removed.

* Task
** Add +source_endpoint_id+, +destination_endpoint_id+,
   +source_endpoint_display_name+, +destination_endpoint_display_name+
   to link:../task#_task_document[task document].

== 4.3

* Admin task pause (new feature)
** Task
*** Added field +is_paused+ to the
    link:../task#task_document[task document]
*** Added
    link:../task#_get_task_pause_info[Get task pause info]
** Advanced Endpoint Management
*** Added
    link:../advanced_endpoint_management#_pause_rule_document[pause rule document]
    and
    link:../advanced_endpoint_management#_get_pause_rules[CRUD APIs]
*** Added
    link:../advanced_endpoint_management#_pause_tasks_as_admin[admin pause]
    API, which supports pausing specific tasks by task id, and
    link:../advanced_endpoint_management#_resume_tasks_as_admin[admin resume]
    for removing the per-task pause and overriding pause rules for the task.
** File Operations
*** Added link:../file_operations#_common_errors[OperationPaused]
    error code.
** Endpoint
*** Added
    link:../endpoint#_get_my_effective_endpoint_pause_rules[Get my effective endpoint pause rules]

* Admin task successful transfers (new feature)
** Advanced Endpoint Management
*** Added
    link:../advanced_endpoint_management#_get_task_successful_transfers_as_admin[Get task successful transfers as admin]

== 4.2

* Endpoint ACL management delegation (new feature)
** Added new role api, see
link:../endpoint_roles[Endpoint Roles].
Granting a user or group the "access_manager" role will allow them to manage
the access rules on an endpoint.
** Added fields to +endpoint+ document type, see
link:../endpoint#changes_42[Endpoint change history]
** Added section to acl document, see
link:../acl#rest_access_delegation[ACL Management Permissions and Delegation]
** Added field to access rule document type, see
link:../acl#changes_42[ACL Management change history]

* Admin task cancel (new feature)
** Task
*** Added fields +canceled_by_admin+ and +canceled_by_admin_message+ to the
link:../task#_task_document[task document]
** Events
*** Change details of the "CANCELED" event. This replaces the current details
of "num_subtasks=N":
**** if canceled by the owner: "Canceled by the task owner"
**** if canceled by an administrator:
"Canceled by the administrator of X",
where X is either "the source endpoint", "the destination endpoint" or
"both source and destination endpoints".
** Advanced Endpoint Management
*** Add new admin cancel API, see
link:../advanced_endpoint_management#admin_cancel[Cancel tasks as admin]. A notification email is sent to the task owner when an administrator
cancels a task.
*** All users with read only +Endpoint Monitor+ management console privileges
on an endpoint will be upgraded to +Endpoint Manager+ privileges, meaning they
will be able to cancel tasks on the endpoints they were monitoring. We do not
yet provide a way of giving a user the ability to monitor tasks without being
able to cancel them.
