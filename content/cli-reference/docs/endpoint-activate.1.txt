= ENDPOINT-ACTIVATE(1)

== NAME

endpoint-activate - Add or renew security credentials

== SYNOPSIS

*endpoint-activate -g  *
.BI [ "pattern" " ...]"
.br
*endpoint-activate *
.BI "[-m " myproxy_server "]"
.BI "[-U " username "]"
.BI "[--dn " dn "]"
.BI "[--myproxy-lifetime " hours "]"
.BI [ "pattern" " ...]"
.br

== DESCRIPTION

*endpoint-activate *
assigns a short term security credential to specified endpoint(s).  If 
'pattern'
is not specified, it defaults to '*', which matches all endpoints shown by 
.B
endpoint-list.  

A security credential is a X.509 proxy certificate delegated through gsi-ssh or
myproxy.  A pass phrase must be entered when retrieving a credential from a
myproxy server.  

If no 
.B
-m
or
.B
-g
option is given, 
.B
endpoint-activate
will attempt to use the default myproxy server for the selected endpoint(s).  
Use the 
.B
endpoint-modify
command to set a default myproxy server.

'pattern'
may contain asterisk ('*') characters for wildcard matching of endpoint names.  
Additionally, 
'pattern '
may contain a 
'user#'
prefix, which matches public endpoints owned by another user.  Activated public endpoint(s) are automatically added to the current user's endpoint list.

== OPTIONS

.TP
*-g          *
Use a gsi-ssh delegated credential

.TP
.BI -m \ HOST     
Retrieve a credential from the specified myproxy server 

.TP
.BI -U \ USER     
Set the myproxy username.  If this is not set, the command will prompt for a
user name.

.TP
.BI --dn \ DN     
Set the myproxy server's subject DN.  Sometimes the myproxy server's
certificate differs from its host name, causing an error.

.TP
.BI --myproxy-lifetime \ HOURS
Set the requested myproxy credential lifetime.  The myproxy server may still
provide a shorter lived credential depending on its configuration.  The default
lifetime is 24 hours, or what the endpoint defines.

== EXAMPLES

.TP
Activate all endpoints using a gsi-ssh credential:
*endpoint-activate -g **

.TP
Activate public endpoints using their default myproxy servers and add them to the current user's endpoint list:
*endpoint-activate teragrid#* nersc#**

.TP
Activate an endpoint using a specific myproxy server:
*endpoint-activate -m myproxy.test.com myep1*
