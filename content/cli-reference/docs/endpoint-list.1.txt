= ENDPOINT-LIST(1)

== NAME

endpoint-list - Show information about endpoints

== SYNOPSIS

*endpoint-list*
.BI [ options ]
.BI [ pattern " ...]"
.br

== DESCRIPTION

*endpoint-list *
shows information about endpoints.  Each logical endpoint has one or more
servers, represented by a URL and an optional subject DN.  Each logical endpoint
may also have a short term security credential which has been assigned by the 
*endpoint-activate *
command.  

By default, 
.B
endpoint-list
displays concise output and only lists the endpoint name (in fully qualified
user#name format) and the hours,
minutes, and seconds remaining until its security credential expires.  If a
credential does not exist or has expired, a '-' will be displayed as the time
remaining.  Use the 
.B
-v 
option to display more fields.  

The
'pattern'
may contain asterisk ('*') characters for wildcard matching of endpoint names.
The default pattern is '*'.  

Use the
.B
-p 
option to display public endpoints shared by other users.  Without
.BR -p ", "
.B
endpoint-list
displays endpoints owned by the current user and any public endpoints that have previously been activated by the current user.
