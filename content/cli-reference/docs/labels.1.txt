= LABELS(7)

== NAME

labels - Task labeling

== DESCRIPTION

Globus Online tasks may be given a user created, arbitrary label to enable easy
categorization and management of lots of tasks.  

Commands that create tasks, like
.BR scp " and " rm ,
accept a 
.BI --label= LABEL 
option to initially set a label.
The
.B
modify
command can set or change a label of a previously created task, even if the
task has already completed.  

The
*status*
command can show a task's label and search tasks by label using wildcarding.
