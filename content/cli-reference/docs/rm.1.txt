= RM(1)

== NAME

rm - Delete files and directories on a server
== SYNOPSIS

*rm *
*[-r]*
*[-f]*
*[options]*
'endpoint/path '
.br
*rm *
*[-r]*
*[-f]*
*[options]*
'endpoint:path '

== DESCRIPTION

The 
*rm *
command is a quick and easy way to delete a single file, directory, or
pattern.   Its semantics are as close as possible to UNIX rm.

The 
'path '
may have a shell-compatible wild card pattern in its final component.
Type 'man glob' for details.

Like UNIX rm, symbolic links are never followed - only unlinked (deleted).


== OPTIONS

.TP
*-r               *
Remove directories and their contents recursively.  Note that just like regular rm, the path does not have to be a directory and symlinks are never followed.

.TP
*-f               *
Ignore nonexistent files and directories.  The operation succeeds if the path does not exist.


.TP
*-g*
Activate the endpoint using your gsi-ssh credential

.\" %start OPT_TASKLABEL
.TP
.BI "--label " LABEL
Set the task's label.  The label can be displayed and searched for in commands
such as 
*status *
and 
.BR details .
See 
.BR labels (7)
for more details on labels.
.\" %end

.\" %start OPT_DEADLINE
.TP
.BI "-d " DEADLINE 
Set the task's deadline.  If the task has not completed by the deadline it
will be automatically canceled.  A suffix of 'm', 'h', or 'd' may be specified
to indicate minutes, hours, or days.  If a unit suffix is not given it is
assumed to be minutes.  Example: '30m', '4h', '1d'.  

If a deadline is not explicitly set, Globus Online will give the task a
flexible deadline that is automatically extended as long as it is making
progress.  
.\" %end

.TP
*-D*
Create a detached (background) task and exit.

.\" %start OPT_UNSAFE
.TP
.BI "--unsafe" 
Remove checks for possible human errors such as deleting all files in / and
/~/.  Only use this option if necessary and always be careful when issuing
delete commands.
.\" %end


== EXAMPLES

.TP
Remove files matching a pattern:
*rm go#ep1/~/Downloads/*.tmp*

.TP
Remove directories matching a pattern:
*rm -rf go#ep1/~/Work/testdir**

.TP
Alternate, SCP-like home directory path syntax:
*rm -rf go#ep1:Work/testdir**



== EXIT STATUS

*-D*
is used, rm returns 0 if the task was successfully created.  If 
*-D *
is not used, rm returns 0 if the task completes successfully or non zero if the task has a fatal error, fails to complete by the deadline, or is canceled.
