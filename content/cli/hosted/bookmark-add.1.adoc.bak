= BOOKMARK-ADD(1)

== NAME

bookmark-add - Create a bookmark to an endpoint and path

== SYNOPSIS

bookmark-add  -n 'NAME' -t 'ENDPOINT/PATH'


== DESCRIPTION

*bookmark-add* creates a new bookmark.  A bookmark is linked to an endpoint
and path.  

The following commands accept bookmarks: ls, mkdir, rename, rm, transfer,
delete, endpoint-activate, endpoint-deactivate, bookmark-add, endpoint-add
--sharing.

The new bookmark has a name 'NAME' which may be up to 128 characters long.
A bookmark named 'NAME' must not already exist for the current user.

Bookmarks are only visible and usable for the user who created them.  If the
target endpoint is private or deleted, the bookmark is unusable.


'PATH' is assumed to be URL-encoded.  'PATH' must be a directory and end with
"/".
