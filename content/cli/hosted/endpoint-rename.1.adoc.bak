= ENDPOINT-RENAME(1)

== NAME

endpoint-rename - Change the legacy name of an endpoint

== SYNOPSIS

*endpoint-rename* 'OLDNAME' 'NEWNAME'

== DESCRIPTION

WARNING: This command is deprecated.  Endpoints now contain a display
name and a UUID, which should be used instead.

*endpoint-rename* changes the legacy name of an endpoint from 'OLDNAME' to
'NEWNAME'.  'OLDNAME' and 'NEWNAME' must be in the old +"user#name"+ format.

Use the *endpoint-modify* command to set or change an endpoint's display name.
Use *endpoint-search* or *endpoint-details* to show an endpoint's UUID, which
is set by the system and can never be changed.



== EXAMPLES

Rename an endpoint called "alice#test_endpoint" to "alice#myep1":

----
$ endpoint-rename alice#test_endpoint alice#myep1
----
