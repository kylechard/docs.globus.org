== NAME

endpoint-search - Search and discover endpoints

== SYNOPSIS

*endpoint-search* ['OPTIONS'] ['SEARCH']

== DESCRIPTION

This command searches for endpoints which have attributes (display name,
legacy name, description, organization, department, keywords) that match the
'SEARCH' text.  The current result size limit is 100 endpoints.

Not all fields are displayed by this command; use the *endpoint-details*
command to get all information for a specific endpoint.

Endpoints that have been deleted are never displayed.


== OPTIONS

*--scope* 'SCOPE'::

Search only endpoints in the specified 'SCOPE' (category).  If this option is
not specified, the scope is "all".  Valid values for 'SCOPE' are:
+
all (default);;
All endpoints for which the current user has visibility (e.g. this includes
public endpoints owned by other users, and private and public endpoints owned
by the current user).  A 'SEARCH' argument is required for this scope.

my-endpoints;;
Endpoints created by the current user.  This includes shared endpoints.

in-use;;
Endpoints that have active or pending tasks submitted by the current user

recently-used;;
Endpoints that have been used for tasks submitted by the current user in the last 90 days.  

shared-by-me;;
Shared endpoints created by the current user

shared-with-me;;
Shared endpoints for which the current user has authorization (e.g. the ACL
allows the current user)



*--owner* 'OWNER'::

Require endpoints where the endpoint is owned by 'OWNER'.  
This is a Globus username.



== OUTPUT FIELDS

The endpoint ID (UUID)

*display_name*::
The endpoint display name

*owner*::
The endpoint owner.  This is a Globus username.

*legacy_name*::
The endpoint name in "USER#NAME" format

*credential_status*::
The current user's credential status: "ACTIVE", "EXPIRED", or "n/a" if the
endpoint is not activated.

*host_endpoint*::
If the endpoint is a shared endpoint, this is its host endpoint ID.

*host_endpoint_name*::
If the endpoint is a shared endpoint, this is its host endpoint display name
or legacy name (the display name is used if it is set).   The name is only
visible if the host endpoint is visible to the current user.  Otherwise, this
field will be null.
