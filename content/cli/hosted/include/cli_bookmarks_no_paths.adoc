=== Endpoint Naming

This command supports the following endpoint identification formats: 

- UUID: `"7865988a-aeb3-4e55-b8cd-938c258e7854"`

- Bookmark: `"^test_bookmark"`.  The bookmark name must be prepended with a
  +"^"+ character.   The bookmark name may have URL-escaped characters.

- Legacy Name: `"bob#test_endpoint"`.  This contains the user
  who owns the endpoint and the endpoint legacy name.

- Unqualified Legacy Name: `"test_endpoint"`.  The user name defaults to the current
  logged in user.
