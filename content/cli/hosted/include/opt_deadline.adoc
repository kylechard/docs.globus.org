*-d* 'DEADLINE'::

Set the task's deadline.  If the task has not completed by the deadline it
will be automatically canceled.  A suffix of "m", "h", or "d" may be specified
to indicate minutes, hours, or days.  If a unit suffix is not given it is
assumed to be minutes.  Example: "30m", "4h", "1d".

If a deadline is not explicitly set, Globus Online will give the task a
flexible deadline that is automatically extended as long as it is making
progress.
