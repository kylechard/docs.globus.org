*--verify-checksum*::

After each file is transferred, verify that the source and destination
checksums match.  If they don't, retransfer the entire file and try checksum
verification again.  Keep trying until verification succeeds.  This is
currently the default.

*--no-verify-checksum*::

Disables the *--verify-checksum* option; no checksum verification is
performed.
