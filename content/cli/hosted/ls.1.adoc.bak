== NAME

ls - List files and directories on an endpoint

== SYNOPSIS

*ls* ['OPTIONS'] 'ENDPOINT/PATH'


== DESCRIPTION

The *ls* command lists files and subdirectories on an endpoint.  

User relative paths may be specified as "`/~/`", "`/~/path/`", or
"`/~otheruser/path`/".  Absolute paths are specified as "`/path/`".  

Files and directories are printed with one entry per line in alphabetical
order.  Directories are always displayed with a trailing "/".

The 'PATH' may have a shell-compatible wild card pattern in its final
component.  Type 'man glob' for details.

count column is not displayed.  Dates and times are displayed in UTC time.



== EXAMPLES

List your home directory in long format:

----
$ ls -l go#ep1/~/
----

List all files matching a pattern:

-----
$ ls -l go#ep1/~/*.txt
-----


== EXIT STATUS

*ls* returns a non zero exit code if a network failure occured, authentication
failed, or the requested file or directory does not exist on the target
server.
