= ACL-REMOVE(1)

== NAME

acl-remove - Delete an Access Rule

== SYNOPSIS

acl-remove 'ENDPOINT' --id 'ID'

== DESCRIPTION

*acl-remove* deletes a specified rule from the endpoint's ACL.  The 'ID' is
returned by *acl-list*.

NOTE: You can not remove the built in rule that gives the endpoint owner full
access.

'ENDPOINT' can use these formats:

include::include/cli_endpoint_unique_id.adoc[]

include::include/more_acl.adoc[]

== OPTIONS

*--id* 'ID'::

The rule ID to remove

== EXAMPLES

Remove an access rule:

----
$ acl-remove karl#myep --id 3
----

== EXIT STATUS

This command is idempotent; removing a non-existent 'ID' will still succeed.
