current user's running tasks will be canceled.

If the task has already completed, or no tasks are currently running, a notice
will be displayed but the command will succeed.

Cancel all of the current user's pending tasks

valid task id.  If the task had already completed, a notice will be displayed
and *cancel* will still return 0.
