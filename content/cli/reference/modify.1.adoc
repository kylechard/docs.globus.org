== NAME

modify - Change a task's properties

== SYNOPSIS

*modify* ['OPTIONS'] 'TASKID'...

== DESCRIPTION

The *modify* command can change properties of task(s), such as deadline and
label.

== OPTIONS

*--deadline* 'DEADLINE'::

Update the task's deadline.  The time given is relative to the current time,
for example "4h" will be the current time plus 4 hours.  A suffix of "m", "h",
or "d" may be specified to indicate minutes, hours, or days.  

*--label* 'LABEL'::

Set the task's label.  See link:../labels[*labels(7)*] for details on labels.

== EXAMPLES

Set a task's deadline to be 3 days from the current time:

----
modify --deadline 3d 8eaa7f3e-32ef-11e0-82be-12313804dcd1
----

Set a task's label to "foo bar":

----
modify --label "foo bar" 8eaa7f3e-32ef-11e0-82be-12313804dcd1
----

== EXIT STATUS

If *--deadline* was specified, *modify* returns a non-zero exit code if the
task had already completed.
