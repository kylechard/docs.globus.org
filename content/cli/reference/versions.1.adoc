= VERSIONS(1)

== NAME

versions - List versions supported by the server, request a specific version

== SYNOPSIS

*versions*

*v=*'VERSION:USER_AGENT' 'COMMAND'

== DESCRIPTION

WARNING: The *versions* command is deprecated.  Please use the REST-API for
long term supported scripting.

*versions* displays a list of service / version strings that are supported by
the server.  A specific version can be requested for a command or a shell by
using the *v=VERSION:USER_AGENT* prefix when running a command or starting the
interactive shell.   If the server does not support the requested version, the
command will fail and an error message will be displayed.

A shell's version may only be specified when it is created and may not be
modified afterward.  If a version is not specified for a command or shell, it
is assumed to be the latest version.

=== Version Strings

The version strings returned by *versions* and used by the *v=* prefix should
be considered opaque tokens and only tested for equality.  Valid version
characters are any printable character excluding whitespace.   

Example version strings include:

* *transfer/1.0.1-3abc*

* *transfer/2.0beta*

If the service portion is omitted when requesting a version, it is assumed to
be "transfer".


=== User Agent

A user agent must be supplied when requesting a version via the *v=* prefix.
This user agent string must be at least 6 characters long and may not contain
whitespace or the ":" character.  The user agent string SHOULD identify the
client / consumer software being used and its version, for example
"MyProgram/3.1".  


== EXAMPLES

The client program "MyProgram/3.1" requests version 1.1 of the transfer
service for a command:

----
$ ssh cli.globusonline.org v=transfer/1.1:MyProgram/3.1 status -a
----

Request version 1.1 (transfer service assumed) for a shell:

----
$ ssh -t cli.globusonline.org v=1.1:MyProgram/3.1
----
