== Which browsers does the Globus web user interface support?
The Globus web user interface is tested and verified to work on the most recent desktop version of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.

Earlier versions of these browsers, as well as other desktop browsers (e.g. Opera) and mobile/touch-based browsers, may experience loss of functionality and/or distorted visual effects. Limited or no support may be available for such browsers.
