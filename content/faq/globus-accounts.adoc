== How do I sign up and transfer files with Globus?
To sign up and transfer files with Globus, please follow this link:../../how-to/signup-transfer/[How-To Guide].

== What’s the difference between Globus and GridFTP?
Globus is software-as-a-service (SaaS) for file transfer. It is a hosted service, operated by the Globus development team, that acts as a third-party mediator/facilitator of file transfers between endpoints that are owned and managed by their respective end users. GridFTP is user-installable software that is part of the Globus Toolkit and is used by grid installers and developers building large-scale data movement solutions. Globus uses the GridFTP protocol for transferring files and currently requires that a GridFTP server be installed on both source and destination endpoints, although HTTP support is planned for a future release. Many HPC resources worldwide already have a GridFTP server installed and can hence be used as Globus endpoints. For individual users, Globus Connect Personal provides a point-and-click way to install a pre-configured GridFTP on your local laptop or desktop. If you are an owner or administrator of a campus cluster or other shared HPC resource, link:https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-server[click here to see how you can turn your resource into a Globus endpoint].

== Does Globus need credentials when accessing my system? Does it store these permanently?
Globus uses only temporary credentials to act on your behalf when making a transfer request, and never keeps your password nor long-term credentials to access a site.

== How does Globus use my Google account?
We provide the option of mapping your Google identity to your Globus account, enabling you to sign on to Globus using your Google credentials instead of your Globus username/password. To add your Google identity to your account follow the "Add External Identity" link on the link:https://www.globus.org/account/ManageIdentities[Manage Identities page] and select the "Google" account provider.

Once your Google identity is mapped to your Globus account you will allow you to log in to Globus as described link:#how_to_use_a_third_party_login_e_g_incommon_xsede_to_access_globus[here].

To remove the association between my Google account and Globus click the “Delete” button next to the Google identity you wish to remove.
