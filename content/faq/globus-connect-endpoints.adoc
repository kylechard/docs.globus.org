= FAQs: Globus Connect and Endpoints

toc::[]

== What is Globus Connect?
Globus Connect is easy-to-install, pre-configured software that turns your laptop, server, cluster or other local resource into a Globus link:../../faq/transfer-sharing#what_is_an_endpoint[endpoint].

There are two versions of Globus Connect, one for use with personal machines such as your laptop, and another for use with server-class machines such as campus computing clusters and lab servers. Use link:https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal[Globus Connect Personal] to enable file transfer to and from your personal machine (laptop or desktop.) A Globus Connect Personal endpoint is intended to be used only by a single user. link:https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-server[Globus Connect Server] enables system administrators to turn shared resources such as campus clusters and lab servers into a Globus endpoint. If it is made publicly visible, a Globus Connect Server endpoint can be used by multiple Globus users.

== How does Globus Connect Personal work?
link:https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal[Globus Connect Personal] uses GSI SSH to maintain a control connection to Globus and await commands. Globus manages transfers to and from the Globus Connect Personal endpoint. Note that file data is still always transferred directly between Globus Connect Personal and a GridFTP server for maximum speed – it is not proxied through Globus.

== How can I create an endpoint?
If there is already a GridFTP server running on your machine you can use the endpoint-add command or the link:https://www.globus.org/xfer/ManageEndpoints[Manage Endpoints webpage] to add an endpoint that refers to that GridFTP server. If there is no existing GridFTP deployment then you have two options, depending on whether the endpoint is a machine for personal use (Globus Connect Personal) or a multi-user server (Globus Connect Server). For personal use, link:https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal[please see the instructions on this page]. For a multi-user machine such as a campus cluster or lab server, link:https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-server[please see the instructions on this page].

== Are transfers between Globus Connect Personal endpoints possible?
Yes. You must be a link:https://www.globus.org/researchers/plus-plans[Globus Plus] user to transfer files between two Globus Connect Personal endpoints. If the two endpoints are owned by different Globus users, both users must be Globus Plus users. You account may be upgraded to Globus Plus if your institution subscribes to a link:https://www.globus.org/provider-plans[Globus Provider plan].

NOTE: You do not need to be a Plus user to transfer files between a link:https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal[Globus Connect Personal] endpoint (e.g. on your laptop) and a link:https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-server[Globus Connect Server] endpoint (e.g. on your lab server or campus cluster). Globus Connect Personal can execute a transfer as long as either the source or destination endpoint has a routable IP address (which is the case for almost all Globus Connect Server endpoints).

== How do I specify paths on Globus Connect Personal running on Windows?
link:https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal[Globus Connect Personal] on Windows will translate a path beginning with /~/ into your home directory, e.g. [uservars]#C:\Users\Anatoly\#. To access paths and drives outside of your home directory, use the syntax +/drive_letter/path+, for example [uservars]#/C/xinfo# lists the C:\xinfo directory.

== Where does Globus Connect Personal store its settings?
Globus Connect stores a few configuration files, such as its private certificate and key, in this location:

- Windows XP: %APPDATA%\Globus Connect
- Windows Vista and 7: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Globus Connect
- OS X and Linux: ~/.globusonline/lta
- On OS X, Globus Connect stores preferences in ~/Library/Preferences/org.globusonline.Globus-Connect.plist

== How do I enable my campus cluster or lab server for moving data to and from other Globus endpoints?
Use link:https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-server[Globus Connect Server], which enables system administrators to create Globus endpoints on shared resources. Globus Connect Server will allow your users to access the Globus endpoint on the server with their existing UNIX user accounts. If you already have a GridFTP and/or MyProxy server installed, please link:https://www.globus.org/contact-us[contact us] for additional information and guidance.

== How do I get a new setup key for a reinstallation of Globus Connect Personal?
In order to reinstall a Globus Connect Personal endpoint and obtain a new setup key, please follow this step-by-step procedure:

1. Quit Globus Connect

2. Delete the entire Globus Connect Personal settings directory - (*\**** THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP \*****):    

-  Windows XP: %APPDATA%\Globus Connect      Personal
- Windows Vista and 7: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Globus Connect     Personal
-  OS X and Linux: ~/.globusonline/lta (LTA stands for the old internal product name, "Lightweight Transfer Agent")

3. Install Globus Connect from scratch through the 3-step process - https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal

- Then, Click "Generate Setup Key".
- Select the generated key with your mouse and copy it to the clipboard.
- Return to the "Initial Setup" window of Globus Connect Personal and paste the setup key into the provided field. The "OK" button will be enabled if the key is valid. Click "OK" to complete the installation. (If the "OK" button is not enabled, please ensure you have properly copied the entire key generated in the previous step above.

Please note the ports that Globus Connect Personal needs open -      

Globus Connect Personal uses only outbound TCP connections. However, it does use a relatively wide port range. It uses 2223 and 50000-51000 when talking to Globus, and when doing a transfer it also uses whatever port range that the other GridFTP server uses. For example, if Globus Connect Personal is transferring to or from a university GridFTP server that is configured to use ports 40000-41000 for data channels, Globus Connect will use those ports (outgoing only).

For more information on the ports used by Globus Connect Personal, [yellow-background]#please see our FAQ page on this topic#.

== How do I setup a Globus Connect Personal Endpoint Using the Command Line?
If you prefer to use the command line interface (CLI) to setup a Globus Connect Personal endpoint, download the installer and run the application as described in one of the installation guides listed below.

* link:../../how-to/globus-connect-personal-mac/[Globus Connect Personal for Mac OS]
* link:../../how-to/globus-connect-personal-windows[Globus Connect Personal for Windows]
* link:../../how-to/globus-connect-personal-linux/[Globus Connect Personal for Linux]

After downloading and installing Globus Connect Personal on your personal computer follow the steps below to complete the setup:

. Log in to cli.globusonline.org using ssh or gsissh:
+
----terminal
$ ssh [input]#demodoc#@cli.globusonline.org
----terminal
. Run the following command to add the endpoint: +endpoint-add --gc <my_endpoint_name>+ and replace [uservars]#<my_endpoint_name># with a name of your choice (e.g. my_laptop).
+
----terminal
$ [input]#endpoint-add --gc my-laptop#
[output]#Created the Globus Connect endpoint \'my-laptop'.
Use this setup key when installing Globus Connect:
7296f199-a347-48d9-800f-326133cb59be#
----terminal
. Select the setup key (ex: "7296f199-a347-48d9-800f-326133cb59be") with your mouse and copy it to the clipboard.
. Return to the "Initial Setup" window of Globus Connect Personal and paste the setup key into the provided field. The "OK" button will be enabled if the key is valid. Click "OK" to complete the installation. (If the "OK" button is not enabled, please ensure you have properly copied the entire key generated in the previous step above.

== What is the purpose of the Globus Connect Personal setup key?
The setup key is a one-time credential used during the Globus Connect Personal installation process to uniquely identify your laptop/personal computer's endpoint to Globus. Once the endpoint is created and the installation is complete the key is discarded.

== Does Globus recognize a USB external drive on my laptop as part of an endpoint?
Yes but, by default, Globus Connect Personal only allows you to access your home directory on your personal computer. Follow these steps to allow Globus to recognize your USB external drive:

. Ensure you have the latest version of Globus Connect Personal installed.
. Open the Globus Connect Personal settings window to add your USB drive. On Mac OS X, click "Preferences" in the Globus Connect Personal menu. On Windows, select the Tools -> Options menu option. On Linux, select the File -> Preferences menu option.
. Click on the "+" button and select your USB drive. Optionally, change the directory path that you would like to access.

Now, when you access your Globus Connect Personal endpoint on the Start Transfer page, you can change the path to the name of your USB drive to browse/transfer files.

== How Do I Configure Accessible Directories on Globus Connect Personal for Linux

When using Globus Connect Personal, you will only be able to transfer files to and from directories on your local computer that are set to be accessible. To configure which directories are accessible to Globus Connect Personal, you must configure the +\~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths+ file. This file is a plain text file, with each line corresponding to the configuration of a particular directory path you wish to make accessible. By default, a +~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths+ file that looks like this will be generated the first time Globus Connect Personal for Linux is run:

----
~/,0,1
----

This configuration tells Globus Connect Personal to make the user’s home directory accessible, and to make it read/write in terms of the ability to do Globus transfers. If we wanted to configure the user’s home directory to be read only with respect to the ability to do Globus transfers we could change config-paths like so:

----
~/,0,0
----
 
If the user wishes to make additional directories accessible, then each new top level path must be given its own line in the +~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths+ file. For example, if the user wanted to enable Globus Connect Personal to access the /data/tables directory then they would add the following line to their config-paths file:

----
/data/tables,0,1
----
 
After making a change to the +~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths+ file you must stop and restart Globus Connect Personal like so before the changes will take effect:

----terminal
$ [input]#./globusconnectpersonal -stop#

$ [input]#./globusconnectpersonal -start &#
----terminal
 
In all cases, it is important to note that a user cannot access a directory or a file via Globus Connect Personal that they don’t have proper unix file permissions for on the local system. Unix file permissions must be considered along with the permissions specified in the config-paths file to determine actual accessibility for a given file or directory. In any case, the most restrictive of the two categories of permissions will always apply.


NOTE: There are some caveats concerning how Globus Connect Personal handles symlinks found in accessible paths. Please read more about that in the following FAQ: link:../transfer-sharing/#how_does_globus_handle_symlinks[How Does Globus Handle Symlinks?]
