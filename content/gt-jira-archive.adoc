=== Summary
RPM packaging for UDT driver

=== Details
*Type:* New Feature

*Status:* Resolved 2013-11-07

=== Description
----jira
We have some colleagues who would benefit from using UDT (they have a high-bandwidth link, but a relatively high rate of packet loss).  Currently, OSG doesn't ship UDT because RPM support is missing in Globus.

I started an email thread about it a few months back, but I don't think it ever resulted in a ticket.  One sticking point was an RPM of UDT itself.  I have a spec file, attached, that packages UDT.

Once that was done, I got lost in the depths of Globus packaging and wasn't able to get a UDT plugin for GridFTP built.

Thanks Brian.  We talked about this recently and expect to work on it shortly after the 5.2.1 release.

Just curious if any progress has been made on getting the UDT XIO driver packaged. Manually building libglobus_xio_udt_driver.so works, but it would be nice to be able to use an RPM instead.

I haven't heard much myself.  Mike?

OSG is still interested in this.
