= How to Access your Google Drive with Globus
:numbered:

Globus users who have access to an endpoint configured with a Google Drive connector can use Globus to access and share content from the Google Drive associated with their Google account.   This section describes how to use this capability.

Use the Google Drive connector-enabled endpoint provided by your site administrator or use the search feature on: https://www.globus.org/app/endpoints?scope=all.   The status column for properly-configured endpoints will contain "GCSv5 Connector".


Choose the endpoint and select the "My Shares" tab. Choose the option to "Add Google Drive Share"

If this is your first time creating a share on this endpoint, you may be prompted to associate a Google Account with your Globus Identity, so that Globus knows which Google Drive you wish to share.
