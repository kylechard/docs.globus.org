=== Installation
. Download and unpack the Globus Connect Personal for Linux installer:
+
----terminal
$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/connect.globusonline.org/linux/stable/globusconnectpersonal-latest.tgz

$ tar xzf globusconnectpersonal-latest.tgz
$ cd globusconnectpersonal-[input]#x.y.z#
----terminal
+
NOTE: In the last line above, replace [uservars]#x.y.z# with the version number from the downloaded file, e.g. globusconnectpersonal-2.0.2.

. Generate a setup key for your endpoint via the Globus command line interface. The example below show an already logged in Globus user generating a setup key for an endpoint called [uservars]#my-linux-laptop#:
+
----terminal
$ globus endpoint create --personal [input]#my-linux-laptop#
[output]#Message:     Endpoint created successfully
Endpoint ID: b19b3b45-01ae-11e6-a71c-22000bf2d559
Setup Key:   224532bb-8a4b-4d32-8995-e1fb442be98e#
----terminal

. Now run the following command to complete the installation (note that you will need to copy and paste the setup key generated in step 2 above):
+
----terminal
$ ./globusconnectpersonal -setup [input]#224532bb-8a4b-4d32-8995-e1fb442be98e#
[output]#Configuration directory: /home/demodoc/.globusonline/lta

----terminal

. Globus Connect Personal is now installed and your endpoint is configured. You should see your endpoint and be able to get its ID if you search for endpoints you own:
+
----terminal
$ globus endpoint search --filter-scope my-endpoints
[output]#ID                                   | Owner                | Display Name
------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------

----terminal

=== Running Globus Connect

To transfer and share files using Globus, start Globus Connect Personal as follows:

----terminal
$ ./globusconnectpersonal -start &
[output]#[1] 2965#
----terminal

Your endpoint is now running and fully usable, which you can confirm with a `globus ls` command using the endpoint's id from above. Note that you do not need to activate the endpoint as Globus Connect Personal endpoints accept automatic activation based on your Globus credentials.

----terminal
$ globus ls b19b3b45-01ae-11e6-a71c-22000bf2d559:/
[output]#home/#
----terminal

The status of Globus Connect Personal running in the background can be controlled using the +-status+ or +-trace+ options. The +-trace+ option provides more detailed information:

----terminal
$ ./globusconnectpersonal -status
[output]#Globus Online: connected
Transfer Status: idle#
$ ./globusconnectpersonal -trace
[output]#gridftp 1
#gsissh connected
#gridftp 1
