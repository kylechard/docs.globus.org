----terminal
+
NOTE: In the last line above, replace [uservars]#x.y.z# with the version number from the downloaded file, e.g. globusconnectpersonal-2.0.2.

. Generate a setup key for your endpoint via the Globus command line interface. The example below shows Globus user [uservars]#demodoc# generating a setup key for an endpoint called [uservars]#my-linux-laptop#:
+
----terminal
$ ssh [input]#demodoc#@cli.globusonline.org
Welcome to globusonline.org, demodoc. Type \'help' for help.
$ endpoint-add -n [input]#my-linux-laptop# --gc
[output]#Endpoint ID: b19b3b45-01ae-11e6-a71c-22000bf2d559

Use this setup key when installing Globus Connect Personal: 
    224532bb-8a4b-4d32-8995-e1fb442be98e#
$ exit
----terminal

. Back in your local machine shell run the following commands to complete the installation (note that you will need to copy and paste the setup key generated in step 2 above):
+
----terminal
$ ./globusconnectpersonal -setup [input]#224532bb-8a4b-4d32-8995-e1fb442be98e#
[output]#Configuration directory: /home/demodoc/.globusonline/lta

----terminal

Globus Connect Personal is now installed and your Globus endpoint is configured.

=== Running Globus Connect
To transfer and share files using Globus, start Globus Connect Personal (and, optionally, activate your endpoint) as follows:

----terminal

----terminal

You should now see your endpoint listed (with active credentials) if you run:

----terminal
$ ssh [input]#demodoc#@cli.globusonline.org endpoint-search --scope my-endpoints
