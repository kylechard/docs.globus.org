Both lights green indicate that Globus Connect Personal is running properly and is connected to Globus. If you have any problems connecting to Globus, you may start the application from the command line using the +-debug+ option (link:../../cli[see more information on running from the command line here]). You may minimize or hide this status window once Globus Connect Personal has connected successfully.

=== Running from the Command Line

If you prefer to run Globus Connect Personal on the Linux command line, specify one of the following six options: +-setup+, +-start+, +-stop+, +-status+, +-debug+, and +-trace+. This will force Globus Connect Personal to remain in command line mode. The status of Globus Connect Personal running in the background can be controlled using the +-status+ or +-trace+ options. The +-trace+ option provides more detailed information.

A typical command line usage scenario might look as follows:

----terminal
$ [input]#sh globusconnect -start &#
[output]#[1] 15268#
----terminal

----terminal
$ [input]#sh globusconnect -status#
[output]#Globus Online: connected

----terminal

----terminal
$ [input]#sh globusconnect -trace#
