== Configuration

You may configure Globus Connect Personal by right-clicking on the Globus Connect Personal icon in the taskbar and selecting "Options...". Configuration options are divided into four groups; the most important (and commonly used) are the "Access" and "General" options. The "Access" tab lists folders that will be accessible via Globus for file transfer and sharing. By default, the only folder listed is your home directory.

You may add folders by clicking the "+" icon and selecting the folder you wish to make accessible. Note that, in most cases, you should not need to add folders other than the default home directory, unless you wish to share files in a different folder with other Globus users. To share a folder, add it to the accessible list and check the "Sharable" box. Note: you must be a Globus Plus user to share files and folders. If you are not a link:https://www.globus.org/plus[Globus Plus] user, click on the "Enable sharing" icon and follow the instructions.

The "General" tab allows you to specify whether you want Globus Connect Personal to run when Windows starts and whether the software should automatically check for updates. We recommend that you leave the "Automatically check for updates" box checked, to ensure that you are running the most stable and secure version of Globus Connect Personal at all times.

[NOTE]
======
_Drive Mapping_: Globus Connect Personal on Windows will translate a path beginning with /~/ into your home directory, e.g. C:\Users\Demodoc\. To access paths and drives outside of your home directory, use the syntax "/drive_letter/path", for example "/C/xinfo" lists the C:\xinfo directory. Also, as discussed above, it would be necessary for the C:\xinfo directory to be permitted in the Accessible Folders configuration as well. If the C:\xinfo directory is not permitted in the Accessible Folders configuration, then that folder will not be accessible via your endpoint.

_Installing as non-administrator_: By default, Globus Connect Personal prompts to be installed in C:\Program Files. Regular users can not write to this folder. Instead, browse to a place you have write access to (e.g. your Desktop folder).
