:numbered:

If you've already signed up to use the Globus Web App, you can link another identity so you can use that to login and perform actions within the Globus Web App. If you haven't signed up yet, you can create a new account by following link:../get-started[these instructions].

'''
== Link to an existing account
Log in to Globus and navigate to the link:https://www.globus.org/app/account[account page]. Click on "Add Linked Identity" in the upper right.

== Log in on your organization's login page
You will then be redirected to your organizationâ€™s login page ([uservars]#Google# in this example). Authenticate as you normally would with the given provider. Depending on the organization you choose, you may encounter a screen that Globus is requesting access to your account information (in this example, Google has a page that states: "Globus would like to:").
