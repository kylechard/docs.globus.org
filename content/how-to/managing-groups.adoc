You can invite users either by providing their email address or by searching for their Globus username. A notification will be sent to the user’s registered email address with a link to use to accept the invitation to the group.

- Invite by email address: Enter the email address for the person you wish to invite. This is a good option to use for members who don’t yet have a Globus account.
