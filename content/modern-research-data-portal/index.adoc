= The Modern Research Data Portal: A Design Pattern for Networked, Data-Intensive Science
:imagesdir: .

We describe a new design pattern, the modern research data portal, that disaggregates the traditional monolithic web portal to achieve orders-of-magnitude increases in data transfer performance, support new deployment architectures that decouple control logic from data storage, and reduce development and operations costs.

A link:[technical article | URL TO BE PROVIDED] describes this design pattern; reviews representative examples at research laboratories and universities (see below); and uses coding examples to demonstrate how Globus APIs can be used to implement a range of research data portal capabilities.

A link:https://github.com/globus/globus-sample-data-portal/notebook.ipynb[Jupyter notebook] demonstrates some Globus features described in the technical article.
  
A link:[simple example data portal | URL TO BE PROVIDED BY VAS] allows you to experiment with an example implementation of the design pattern.


A link:https://github.com/globus/globus-sample-data-portal[GitHub repository] provides code for the simple data portal that you can experiment with online.

A link:mrdp-description[companion web site] provides a narrative description of the simple data portal code.
