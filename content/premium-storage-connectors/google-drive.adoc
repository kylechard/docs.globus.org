== Prerequisites
This connector requires a fully functional Globus Connect Server Version 5 (GCSv5) endpoint.

In addition, a Google Account is required. It will be used to register the GCSv5 endpoint manager as a Google OAuth client.

IMPORTANT: Please be sure to verify your GCSv5 endpoint is functional before you move on to configure the Google Drive Connector.

== Globus Connect Server v5 Install Instructions

=== Introduction
Globus Connect Server version 5 is a new major release of the server. The current release is a beta version of the server and has limited storage systems that it can support. At this time, this version of the server is supported only as a clean install on a system. 

IMPORTANT: Existing Globus Connect Server (v4) installations cannot be upgraded to this new server at this time. Globus Connect version 5 installations need to be on a separate machine. Upgrade tools are planned and will be made available in the future.

=== Supported Linux distributions
- RHEL 7
- CentOS 7

=== Globus Connect Server v5 Firewall Policy Requirements
If your system is behind a firewall, select TCP ports must be open for Globus to work. You may need to coordinate with your network or security administrator to open the ports.

The TCP ports that must be open for the default Globus Connect Server v5 installation, together with brief descriptions of each, are listed here:

* Port 2811 inbound from 184.73.189.163 and 174.129.226.69
** Used for GridFTP control channel traffic.
* Ports 50000—51000 inbound and outbound to/from Any
** Used for GridFTP data channel traffic.
** The use of the default port range is strongly recommended (you can read why link:../globus-connect-server-installation-guide/#data_channel_traffic[here]).
** Data channel traffic is sent directly between endpoints—it is not relayed by the Globus service.
* Port 7512 inbound from 174.129.226.69
** Used for MyProxy traffic.
** Needed if your server will run MyProxy service.
* Port 2223 outbound to 184.73.255.160 
** Used to pull certificate information from the Globus service.
* Port 80 outbound to Any
** Used to pull Globus Connect Server install packages from the Globus repository.
* Port 80 inbound from Any 
** Used to register for certificates with Let's Encrypt service. (Only necessary when first setting up GCS)
* Port 443 outbound to Any
** Used to communicate with the Globus service via its REST API.
** nexus.api.globusonline.org is a CNAME for an Amazon link:http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/[ELB]; IP addresses in the ELB are subject to change.
** Used to communicate with Google Drive servers.
* Port 443 inbound from Any 
** Used by GCS Manager Service.
** Used to communicate with Google Drive servers.
** Used to register for certificates with Let's Encrypt service.


















== Prepare a Google project for use with Globus
You must have a Google account to complete this step. 

. Go to the following URL:
** https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/projects
. Click "Create Project" button
. After creating the project, Click on the "Credentials" menu, then click on the "Create Credentials" button and select the "OAuth client ID" option.
. Configure the Consent screen.
. When prompted, choose "Web application" as the Application type.
. When naming the application be sure to choose a name that is descriptive so users will recognize the application.
** Make very careful note of the Google Client ID and Google Client Secret you get in this step.
+
IMPORTANT: A set of Google credentials can only be used with a single GCSv5 installation. If you wish to install multiple instances you must create a new Google application for each one.
+
. Configure an entry for "Authorized redirect URIs" as follows:
** +++https://YOUR_SERVER_FQDN_HOSTNAME/api/v1/authcallback_google+++
** The "YOUR_SERVER_FQDN_HOSTNAME" value must be:
*** Resolvable in public DNS.
*** The value that the [GCS Manager].ServerName option is / will be set to in the globus-connect-server.conf file.
. You must now enable the Drive API for your project before it can be used. Click on the "Library" menu for your project, and then click on the "Drive API" link. After that, press the "Enable" button to enable the DriveAPI for your project.

TIP: You may wish to provide instructions for your users on how to disconnect this Google application from their accounts. They may do so by visiting https://myaccount.google.com and clicking on the "Connect apps & sites" link.

== Configure your GCSv5 endpoint to use the Google Drive Connector 
This section requires that a Globus Connect Server v5 endpoint has been setup and is functional. The basic installation of GCSv5 sets it up for use with POSIX file systems. The following instructions will replace the default endpoint configuration, and reconfigure GCSv5 for use with the Google Drive Connector. 

*Edit globus-connect-server.conf to set the following parameters:*

. set [Endpoint].StorageType = Google Drive 
. set [Security].IdentityMethod = None
. set [Security].AuthorizationMethod = Gridmap
. set [GridFTP].Sharing = True
. set [GridFTP].ServiceCredentialSource = Globus
. set [GridFTP].CertificateFile = %(ROOT)s/var/lib/globus-connect-server/grid-security/gridftp-hostcert.pem
. set [GridFTP].KeyFile = %(ROOT)s/var/lib/globus-connect-server/grid-security/gridftp-hostkey.pem
. comment out [MyProxy].ServerName
. comment out [MyProxy].ServerHost
. comment out [OAuth].ServerName
. comment out [OAuth].ServerHost
. set [GCS Manager].Domains = comma separated list of identity domains you wish to be able to create shares on this endpoint.
. In globus-connect-server.conf, set [GCS Manager].ServiceCredentialSource = LetsEncrypt
. set [GCS Manager].CertificateFile = %(ROOT)s/var/lib/globus-connect-server/grid-security/gcsmanager-hostcert.pem
. set [GCS Manager].KeyFile = %(ROOT)s/var/lib/globus-connect-server/grid-security/gcsmanager-hostkey.pem
. set [Google Drive].ClientId = the Google Client ID obtained in Section 2.5
. set [Google Drive].ClientSecret = the Google Client Secret obtained in Section 2.5
. set [LetsEncrypt].Email = admin email address
. set [LetsEncrypt].AgreeToS = True
. [GridFTP].ServerName and [GCS Manager].ServerName must both be set to the same publicly resolvable DNS name. On an aws ec2 instance, that name must also NOT be the aws public DNS name (e.g. gcs.mydomain.com and not ec2-w-x-y-z.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com)
. Run `globus-connect-server-setup` to create the endpoint definition and configure the GCS services locally
. Find endpoint by searching for Display Name of endpoint here: 
+
https://www.globus.org/app/endpoints?scope=all
+
. Make note of the endpoint's UUID on the Overview tab
. Contact Globus support to make your new endpoint managed. Be sure to send support the UUID of your endpoint from Step 22.
. Once Globus Support notifies you that your endpoint has been made managed, you'll want to grant at least one Globus ID the Administrator Role for your new endpoint. You will do this by running the `/opt/globus/bin/add_admin_role` script and then following the prompts. For example, to grant the "abc" Globus ID the Administrator Role for your endpoint, you would do this:
+
----
# /opt/globus/bin/add_admin_role
Add administrator role for this identity username: abc@globusid.org

...
----
+
After the identity is granted the Administrator Role, you should be able to log in to the Globus website using that same Globus ID and then find your endpoint by searching for it in the Manage Endpoints page using the "administered by me" scope.
+
. After the base endpoint has been made managed, permitted users can then create shares hosted by the endpoint that will be backed by their Google Drives. See separate instructions for process to create shares on Google Drive backed endpoint.

[NOTE]
=======
When GCSv5 is configured to use Let's Encrypt certs a new daily cron job will be set up on your system the first time that the `globus-connect-server-setup` command is run. This cron job will check your GCSv5 certs and renew them as needed. You can also force this check at any time by manually running the job like so:

----terminal
# /etc/cron.daily/gcs-letsencrypt-renew
----terminal

Without this cron job, the Let's Encrypt certs being used by your GCSv5 endpoint will expire (90 days after they were created, when GCSv5 was first installed) and your endpoint will stop functioning properly.
=======




== Share a Google Drive folder using Globus
This section describes creating a shared endpoint to access your files and folders on Google Drive using the Globus interface.

. Find the GCSv5 Connector endpoint that you"ll use to create your Google Drive share on the "Manage Endpoints" page, by searching in the "all" scope. Note that the endpoint must support the Google Drive Premium Connector. Choose the endpoint and select the "My Shares" tab. Then click the "Add Google Drive Share" button.
+
[role="img-responsive center-block"]
image::images/google_drive-1.png[]
+
. If this is your first time creating a share on this endpoint, you may be prompted to associate a Google Account with your Globus Identity, so that Globus knows which Google Drive you wish to share.
+
[role="img-responsive center-block"]
image::images/google_drive-2.png[]
+
. Configure the details for your share. Click the "Create Endpoint" button when done.
+
[role="img-responsive center-block"]
image::images/google_drive-3.png[]
+
. Grant the endpoint access to your Google drive.
+
[role="img-responsive center-block"]
image::images/google_drive-4.png[]
+
. Your share has now been created.
