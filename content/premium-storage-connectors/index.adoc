Premium storage connectors enable you to add Globus endpoints to access non-POSIX filesystems, including various object stores and archival storage systems. We currently support the following systems via premium storage connectors:

- link:aws-s3[Amazon Web Services S3 Connector]
- link:black-pearl[SpectraLogic BlackPearl]
////
- link:ceph-connector-q1[Ceph object stores]
- Google Drive (coming soon)
- link:hpss[High Performance Storage System (HPSS)]
////

Premium storage connectors are available only on managed endpoints covered under a Globus Standard subscription. 

Every premium connector requires a working Globus Connect Server deployment, and installation of additional package that is custom for the storage system.
