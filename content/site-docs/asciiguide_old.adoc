== Paragraphs
=== _Normal_
Paragraphs don't require any special markup in AsciiDoc.
A paragraph is just one or more lines of consecutive text.

To begin a new paragraph, separate it by at least one blank line.

=== _Line breaks_
Rubies are red, +
Topazes are blue.

=== _Literal_
A normal paragraph.

 A sequence of lines that begin with at least one space is a literal paragraph.
 Literal paragraphs are treated as preformatted text.
 The text is shown in a fixed-width font
 and endlines are preserved.

Another normal paragraph.

=== _Admonition_
NOTE: An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to
auxiliary information.
Its purpose is determined by the label
at the beginning of the paragraph.

Here are the other built-in admonition types:

TIP: Pro tip...

IMPORTANT: Don't forget...

WARNING: Watch out for...

CAUTION: Ensure that...

 NOTE: Icons can be turned on for these, but only asciidoctor renders fontawesome icons; we can use custom icons with asciidoc by adding them to the /images/icons directory and setting the icons attribute.

=== _Lead paragraph (broken, syntax of "[.lead]" won't compile)_
//[.lead]
This text will be styled as a lead paragraph (i.e., larger font).

=== _Complex content in outline lists_
* Every list item has at least one paragraph of content,
  which may be wrapped, even using a hanging indent.
+
Additional paragraphs or blocks are adjoined by putting
a list continuation on a line adjacent to both blocks.
+
list continuation:: a plus sign (`{plus}`) (broken) on a line by itself

* A literal paragraph does not require a list continuation.

 $ gem install asciidoctor

* AsciiDoc lists may contain any complex content.

== \Footnotes (broken, needed to escape word since it kept breaking toc)
=== _Normal and reusable footnotes_
A statement.footnote:[Clarification about this statement.]

A bold statement.footnoteref:[disclaimer,Opinions are my own.]

Another bold statement.footnoteref:[disclaimer]

'''

== TODO: "Broken" Notes & Adjustments
. ToC sometimes repeats; may need to check asciidoc.js and timer?
. footnotes completely broken
. monospace letters broken; maybe add styling for .monospace?
. monospace + bold or italic broken; check conf file
. images broken; needed to remove ":" after image
. internal cross reference links adding brackets when not given link text

'''
Lower priority "Broken" Notes & Adjustments

. role doesn't work; either it doesn't filter at all or is instead assigned as a class
. lead paragraph styling not working; not in conf file?
. single and double quotes not working; adjust conf file
. add h6 to conf file
. not sure pagebreaks are necessary?
. interactive checklist broken (won't compile); check conf?
. embedded videos don't work at all
. content won't flow around sidebar; it's in an <aside> with class of sidebar-block
. open block broken
. custom substitutions example broken; think this is a asciidoc/doctor issue
. attribute declaration checked box won't compile
. built-in literals attributes: startsb, endsb do nothing
. built-in entity attributes: apos, quot
. built-in data attributes: asciidoctor, asciidoctor-version, docdatetime, docdir, docfile, localdatetime all do nothing, but most of these might be doc/doctor issues
. named substitutions: all broken; need to check usage?
. Textual symbol replacements: em dash broken; check conf?
. toc-right is broken, but I think this is low priority

== HTML4 vs HTML5
. all h2 elements are surrounded by a div with section1 class applied in html5
. horizontal rules between h2 elements in html4
. video: totally broken in html4, partially broken in html5
. more delimited blocks: sidebar is table in html4 (broken) and is div with class "sidebarblock" in html5 (needs styling to work)
. Table with formatted, aligned and merged cells: html4 renders 6, 7 & 10 in code tags while html5 gives them monospaced class
. Footnotes: html4 "opinions are my own" rendered as italic link with name "_footnote_disclaimer" while html5 renders it as plain text with span class "footnote" and id "_footnote_disclaimer"
