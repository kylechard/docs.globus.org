    <h3 class="media-heading">Brown University</h3>
    <p>Computational scientists at Brown University are using the Globus Toolkit and <a href="http://www.niu.edu/mpi/">MPICH-G2</a> to simulate the flow of blood through human arteries. This image, prepared at Argonne National Laboratory, shows velocity (red arrows) and pressure (surface color) within a branched, three-dimensional arterial structure. The simulation was conducted using <a href="http://www.cfm.brown.edu/people/tcew/nektar.html">Nektar</a> (software developed at Brown University) and was the first high-performance simulation to run in a distributed fashion using systems at multiple <a href="http://www.teragrid.org/">TeraGrid</a> sites.</p>

    <p>Globus Toolkit-driven Grid computing is central to management of large datasets generated by colliders such as those at <a href="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</a>. This simulation shows two colliding lead ions just after impact, with quarks in red, blue, and green and hadrons in white. </p>

  	<h3 class="media-heading">Southern California Earthquake Center</h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.scec.org/">Southern California Earthquake Center</a> uses Globus software to visualize earthquake simulation data. Scientists simulate earthquakes by calculating the effect of shock waves as they propagate through various layers of a geological model. SCEC simulations cover a very large space with very high resolution and can generate up to 40TB of data per simulation run. This image shows earth movement from San Joaquin Valley CA, to Mexico, across the Los Angeles basin, moments after a simulated rupture. Blue and red lobes depict motion in opposite directions caused by shock waves along the fault.</p>

    <p>Scientists in the <a href="http://www.fusiongrid.org/">National Fusion Collaboratory</a> are learning to use the Access Grid and Globus Web services to <a href="/alliance/publications/papers/clade_submitted_corrected.pdf">participate remotely in pulsed plasma fusion experiments</a>. The remote interface provides sensor readings, data analysis, audio, and video available in the control room and allows the team to discuss what is happening. The <a href="http://www.accessgrid.org/">Access Grid</a> is integrated with Grid services and applications using the Globus Toolkit's security and communication libraries.</p>

Scientists simulate earthquakes by calculating the effect of shock waves as they propagate through various layers of a geological model. This image shows the velocity of motion from a simulated earthquake through a uniform earth. The image is provided in stereo so that it can be viewed in 3D.</p>

  	<p>The Globus Toolkit supports scientific data visualization on the <a href="http://www.teragrid.org/">TeraGrid</a>. This image is part of a sequence that reveals the progression of Hurricane Isabel in September 2003. A desktop application uses the Globus Toolkit to launch parallel visualization tasks on multiple TeraGrid graphics nodes. The application allows users to connect to and interact with these tasks.

   	<p>Physicists used the Globus Toolkit and MPICH-G2 to harness the power of multiple supercomputers to simulate the gravitational effects of black hole collisions. The team, which included researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Chicago, Northern Illinois University, and the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Germany, was awarded a prestigious <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~pieper/SUCCESS/gordon01.html">Gordon Bell prize</a> for its work.
