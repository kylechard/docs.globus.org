<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

    <p>The Scheduler Event Generator (or SEG) is an application which uses
    scheduler-specific monitors to report job state changes to the Managed
    Job Service.  The SEG modules themselves implement a simple interface
    (described here) to generate events from a scheduler. This document
    describes how to write a SEG module for a scheduler, using
    the LSF scheduler implementation as an example.</p>


    <h2>Scheduler Event Generator Module</h2>
    <p>The SEG module for a scheduler may use whatever method is most
    appropriate for receiving events from the scheduler. At the time of
    writing this, all SEG modules have relied on scheduler log files to
    determine when to issue events. The main reasons for this are:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Restartability</dt>
      <dd>In the case the Web Service Container fails and restarts, the
      SEG module must be able to resume generating events from the last 
      state the container had persisted.</dd>
      <dt>Performance</dt>
      <dd>Earlier job monitoring mechanisms used by GRAM relied on actively
      polling the scheduler. This caused the head node of the scheduler
      to be overloaded and perform poorly. By watching log files, the
      computation required to obtain job state is reduced dramatically.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Even with these considerations, it might be appropriate in a SEG
    module for some particular scheduler to use some scheduler API to receive
    events directly from the scheduler if it provides a suitable API.</p>

    <h3>Module descriptor</h3>
    <p>The SEG module for a scheduler is implemented as a globus extension C shared library
    which contains a <code>globus_module_descriptor</code>. The module 
    descriptor symbol must be named
    <code>globus_scheduler_event_module_ptr</code>.In the lsf SEG module, we
    have</p>

    <pre>
#include "globus_common.h"
#include "globus_scheduler_event_generator.h"
#include "version.h"

    ...

GlobusExtensionDefineModule(globus_seg_lsf) =
{
    "globus_seg_lsf",
    globus_l_lsf_module_activate,
    globus_l_lsf_module_deactivate,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    &local_version
};

    </pre>

    <p>The <code>globus-scheduler-event-generator</code> program will interact
    with the scheduler-specific module by activating the extension (resulting
    in the module's activate (<code>globus_l_lsf_module_activate</code>) and
    deactivate (<code>globus_l_lsf_module_deactivate</code>) functions to
    be invoked.</p>

    <h3>Activation and Deactivation</h3>
    <p>Within the module activation function, we'll initialize Globus modules
    that we will use, initialize our state structure and register an event
    with the Globus event driver to enable us to begin searching the log
    file for job events. The call to
    <code>globus_scheduler_event_generator_get_timestamp</code> will
    return in its parameter the timestamp from which the scheduler module
    should begin issuing events from. If this value is 0, then the monitor
    should begin issuing events from the current time and ignore any previous
    scheduler state changes.</p>

    <p>At module deactivation, the LSF SEG module waits until all log
    searching events have finished and then deactivates the modules it 
    activated.</p>

    <h3>LSF State</h3>
    <p>Let's look a bit at the logfile state structure.  This structure
    contains the information we need to reliably parse the LSF log files.
    Most of the logic in the LSF SEG module is related to keeping track of
    which log file is currently being read and where in that file we can
    parse events from (somewhat complicated by the fact that the LSF log
    files are renamed from time to time). We have to be careful to make sure
    that when we parse an event from the logfile that the logfile hasn't been
    written to during our read and that the event occurs after the starting
    timestamp we are interested.</p>
    
    <p> We also keep track of the path to the LSF log directory, the current
    log file we are parsing, our location within the logfile, and a buffer of
    partial events which we've read. All of this information is threaded
    throw the callbacks </p>

    <h3>Read Callback</h3>
    <p>The read callback is called periodically to check to see if any new
    events are available from the log file.  To make sure we are keeping
    things consistent, we will <code>stat</code> the LSF index file which is
    changed whenever logs are rotated before we issue events for any log
    messages we read. After we have a buffer of valid data, we parse it and
    call functions in the SEG API to generate events from the data we read.
    </p>

    <p>If we our read was up to the end of the active log file, we delay
    our next read for a few seconds before the read callback will be called
    again---the file is currently lacking new events. Otherwise, we schedule
    a new read callback to occur as soon as possible. We do not loop around
    the reads so that the SEG events we register with the API can occur.</p>

    <h3>Getting Logfile Path</h3>
    <p>For LSF, the rotated log files are named <code>lsb.events.#</code> with
    the number ranging from 1 to some system-configuration dependent number.
    The smallest numbered log file is the most recent rotated one. The
    current log file is <code>lsb.events</code>. Normally,
    only the current log file is used, but if that file is rotated
    while we are reading from it, or if the restart timestamp is before the
    beginning of the current file, then we must search the log files for one
    which begins after the event timestamp we're interested in.<p>

    <p>Other schedulers have different methods of handling these log files
    (PBS has one log file per day, our Fork implementation does not yet
    implement any log rotation).</p>

    <h3>Parsing and Generating events</h3>
    <p>The event parsing function is entirely scheduler dependent. The code
    scans the lsb event lines from the log file and generates appropriate
    calls to the Globus Scheduler Event Generator API to send messages to
    the Job State Monitor. The most often used API calls are those which
    map to GRAM job state changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>globus_scheduler_event_pending</li>
      <li>globus_scheduler_event_active</li>
      <li>globus_scheduler_event_done</li>
      <li>globus_scheduler_event_failed</li>
    </ul>
