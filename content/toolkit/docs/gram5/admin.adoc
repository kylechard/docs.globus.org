== GRAM5 Installation
=== Introduction
The Globus Toolkit provides GRAM5: a service to submit, monitor, and cancel jobs on Grid computing resources. In GRAM5, a job consists of a computation and, optionally, file transfer and management operations related to the computation. Some users, particularly interactive ones, benefit from accessing output data files as the job is running. Monitoring consists of querying for and/or subscribing to status information, such as job state changes.

GRAM5 relies on link:../../gsi[GSI C] mechanisms for security, and interacts with link:../../gridftp[GridFTP] services to stage files to compute resources. Please see their respective Administrator's guides for information about installing, configuring, and managing those systems. In particular, you must understand the tasks in link:../../installation[Installing GT 6.0] and install the basic GRAM5 packages, and complete the tasks in link:../../installation#basic_security_configuration[Basic Security Configuration].

=== Planning your GRAM5 installation
Before installing GRAM5 on a server, you'll first need to plan what Local Resource Managers (LRMs) you want GRAM5 to interface with, what LRM you want to have as your default GRAM5 service, and whether you'll be using the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` to process LRM events.

GRAM5 requires a few services to be running to function: the Gatekeeper and the Scheduler Event Generator (SEG). The supported way to run these services is via the System-V style init scripts provided with the GRAM5-related packages. The gatekeeper daemon can also be configured to start via an internet superserver such as `inetd` or `xinetd` though that is beyond the scope of this document. The `globus-scheduler-event-generator` can not be run in that way.

==== Choosing an LRM Adapter

GRAM5 in GT 6.0 supports the following LRM adapters: Condor, PBS, GridEngine, and Fork. These LRM adapters translate GRAM5 job specifications into LRM-specific job descriptions and scripts to run them, as well as interfaces to the LRM to determine job termination status.

If you're not familiar with the supported LRMs, you might want to start with the Fork one to get familiar with how GRAM5 works. This adapter simply forks the job and runs it on the GRAM5 node. You can then install one of the other LRMs and its adapter to provide batch or high-throughput job scheduling.

===== Default GRAM5 Service

GRAM5 can be configured to support multiple LRMs on the same service machine. In that case, one LRM is typically configured as the default LRM which is used when a client uses a shortened version of a GRAM5 link:../user#resource_name[resource name]. A common configuration is to configure a batch system interface as the default, and provide the [monospaced]#jobmanager-fork# service as well for simple jobs, such as creating directories or staging data.

===== Job Status Method

GRAM5 has two ways of determining job state transitions: polling the LRM and using the Scheduler Event Generator (SEG) service. When polling, each user's `globus-job-manager` will periodically execute an LRM-specific command to determine the state of each job. On systems with many users, or with users submitting a large number of jobs, this can cause significant resource use on the GRAM5 service machine. Instead, the GRAM5 service can be configured (on a per-LRM basis) to use the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` service to more efficiently process LRM state changes.

NOTE: Not all LRM adapters provide an interface to the `globus-scheduler-event-generator`, and some require LRM-specific configuration to work properly. This is described in more detail.

=== Installing LRM Adapter Package
There are several LRM adapters included in the GT 6.0. For some, there is a [file]#-setup-poll# and [file]#-setup-seg# package which installs the adapter and configuration file needed for job status via polling or the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` program.

There are three ways to get LRM adapters: as RPM packages, as Debian packages, and from the source installer. These installation methods are described in Installing GT 6.0.

LRM adapter packages included in the GT 6.0 release are:

.GRAM5 LRM Adapters

|========

== Common Administrative Tasks
There are several tools provided with GT 6.0 to manage GRAM5, as well as OS-specific tools to start and stop some of the services. There are tools to manage user authorization, which services are enabled, which scheduler event generator modules are enabled, and to test the `globus-gatekeeper` service.

=== Managing GRAM5 Users
Before a user may interact with the GRAM5 service to submit jobs, he or she must be authorized to use the service. In order to be authorized, a GRAM5 administrator must add the user's credential name and local account mapping to the [file]#/etc/grid-mapfile#. This can be done using the `grid-mapfile-add-entry` and `grid-mapfile-delete-entry` tools. For more information, see the link:../../gsi[GSI C] manual.

=== Starting and Stopping GRAM5 services
In order to run the service, the `globus-gatekeeper`, and, if applicable to your configuration, the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` services must be running on your system. The packages for these services include init scripts and configuration files which can be used to configure, start, and stop the service.

The `globus-gatekeeper` and `globus-scheduler-event-generator` init scripts handle the following actions: `start`, `stop`, `status`, `restart`, `condrestart`, `try-restart`, `reload`, and `force-reload`. The `globus-scheduler-event-generator` script also accepts another optional parameter to start or stop a particular `globus-scheduler-event-generator` module. If the second parameter is not present, then all services will be acted on.

==== Debian Specifics

If you installed using Debian packaging tools, then the services will automatically be started upon installation. To start or stop the service, use the command `invoke-rc.d` with the service name and action.

==== RPM Specifics

If you installed using the RPM packaging tools, then the services will be installed but not enabled by default. To enable the services to start at boot time, use the commands:

----terminal
#  chkconfig globus-gatekeeper on
#  chkconfig globus-scheduler-event-generator on
----terminal

To start or stop the services, use the `service` command to run the init scripts with the service name and action and optional `globus-scheduler-event-generator` module.

=== Enabling and Disabling GRAM5 Services
The GRAM5 packages described in link:#installing_lrm_adapter_packages[Installing LRM Adapter Packages] will automatically register themselves with the `globus-gatekeeper` and `globus-scheduler-event-generator` services. The first LRM adapter installed will be configured as the default Job Manager service. To list the installed services, change the default, or disable a service, use the `globus-gatekeeper-admin` tool.

.Example 2.1. Using globus-gatekeeper-admin to set the default service

This example shows how to use the `globus-gatekeeper-admin` tool to list the available services and then choose one as the default:

----terminal
#  globus-gatekeeper-admin -l
[output]#jobmanager-condor [ENABLED]
jobmanager-fork-poll [ENABLED]
jobmanager-fork [ALIAS to jobmanager-fork-poll]#
#  globus-gatekeeper-admin -e jobmanager-condor -n jobmanager
#  globus-gatekeeper-admin -l
[output]#jobmanager-condor [ENABLED]
jobmanager-fork-poll [ENABLED]
jobmanager [ALIAS to jobmanager-condor]
jobmanager-fork [ALIAS to jobmanager-fork-poll]#
----terminal

=== Enabling and Disabling SEG Modules
The `-setup-seg` packages described in link:#installing_lrm_adapter_packages[Installing LRM Adapter Packages] will automatically register themselves with the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` service. To disable a module from running when the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` service is started, use the globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin tool.

This example shows how to stop the pbs `globus-scheduler-event-generator` module and disable it so it will not restart when the system is rebooted:

----terminal
#  /etc/init.d/globus-scheduler-event-generator stop pbs
[output]#Stopped globus-scheduler-event-generator                   [  OK  ]#
#  globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin -d pbs
#  globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin -l
[output]#pbs [DISABLED]#
----terminal

== Configuring GRAM5
GRAM5 is designed to be usable by default without any manual configuration. However, there are many ways to customize a GRAM5 installation to better interact with site policies, filesystem layouts, LRM interactions, logging, and auditing. In addition to GRAM5-specific configuration, see link:../../gsi/admin#configuring[Configuring GSI] for information about configuring GSI security.

=== Gatekeeper Configuration
The `globus-gatekeeper` has many configuration options related to network configuration, security, logging, service path, and nice level. This configuration is located in:

RPM Package::
[output]#/etc/sysconfig/globus-gatekeeper#
Debian Package::
[output]#/etc/default/globus-gatekeeper#
Source Installer::
[output]#_PREFIX_/etc/globus-gatekeeper.conf#

The following configuration variables are available in the `globus-gatekeeper` configuration file:

GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_PORT::
Gatekeeper Service Port. If not set, the `globus-gatekeeper` uses the default of [output]#2119#.
GLOBUS_LOCATION::
Globus Installation Path. If not set, the `globus-gatekeeper` uses the paths defined at package compilation time.
GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_LOG::
Gatekeeper Log Filename. If not set, the `globus-gatekeeper` logs to syslog using the [output]#GRAM-gatekeeper# log identification prefix. The default configuration value is [output]#/var/log/globus-gatekeeper.log#
GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_GRID_SERVICES::
Path to grid service definitions. If not set, the `globus-gatekeeper` uses the default of [output]#/etc/grid-services.#.
GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_GRIDMAP::
Path to grid-mapfile for authorization. If not set, the `globus-gatekeeper` uses the default of [output]#/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile.#.
GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_CERT_DIR::
Path to a trusted certificate root directory. If not set, the `globus-gatekeeper` uses the default of [output]#/etc/grid-security/certificates.#.
GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_CERT_FILE::
Path to the gatekeeper's certificate. If not set, the `globus-gatekeeper` uses the default of [output]#/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem.#.
GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_KEY_FILE::
Path to the gatekeeper's private key. If not set, the `globus-gatekeeper` uses the default of [output]#/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem.#.
GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_KERBEROS_ENABLED::
Flag indicating whether or not the `globus-gatekeeper` will use a kerberos GSSAPI implementation instead of the GSI GSSAPI implementation (untested).
GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_KMAP::
Path to the KMAP authentication module. (untested).
GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_PIDFILE::
Path to a file where the `globus-gatekeeper` 's process ID is written. If not set, `globus-gatekeeper` uses [output]#/var/run/globus-gatekeeper.pid#
GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_NICE_LEVEL::
Process nice level for `globus-gatekeeper` and `globus-job-manager` processes. If not set, the default system process nice level is used.

After modifying the configuration file, restart the `globus-gatekeeper` using the methods described in link:../../gram5/admin#starting_and_stopping_gram5_services[Starting and Stopping GRAM5 services].

=== Scheduler Event Generator Configuration
The `globus-scheduler-event-generator` has several configuration options related to filesystem paths. This configuration is located in:

RPM Package::
[output]#/etc/sysconfig/globus-scheduler-event-generator#
Debian Package::
[output]#/etc/default/globus-scheduler-event-generator#
Source Installer::
[output]#PREFIX/etc/globus-scheduler-event-generator.conf#

The following configuration variables are available in the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` configuration file:

GLOBUS_SEG_PIDFMT::
Scheduler Event Generator PID file path format. Modify this to be the location where the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` writes its process IDs (one per configured LRM). The format is a `printf` format string with one %s to be replaced by the LRM name. By default, `globus-scheduler-event-generator` uses [output]#/var/run/globus-scheduler-event-generator-%s.pid.#.
GLOBUS_SEG_LOGFMT::
Scheduler Event Generator Log path format. Modify this to be the location where `globus-scheduler-event-generator` writes its event logs. The format is a `printf` format string with one %s to be replaced by the LRM name. By default, `globus-scheduler-event-generator` uses [output]#/var/lib/globus/globus-seg-%s#. If you modify this value, you'll need to also update the LRM configuration file to look for the log file in the new location. If you modify this value, you'll need to also update the LRM configuration file to look for the log file in the new location.
GLOBUS_SEG_NICE_LEVEL::
Process nice level for `globus-scheduler-event-generator processes`. If not set, the default system process nice level is used.

After modifying the configuration file, restart the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` using the methods described in link:../../gram5/admin#starting_and_stopping_gram5_services[Starting and Stopping GRAM5 services].

=== Job Manager Configuration
The `globus-job-manager` process is started by the `globus-gatekeeper` and uses the configuration defined in the service entry for the resource name. By default, these service entries use a common configuration file for most job manager features. This configuration is located in:

RPM Package::
[output]#/etc/globus/globus-gram-job-manager.conf#
Debian Package::
[output]#/etc/globus/globus-gram-job-manager.conf#
Source Installer::
[output]#PREFIX/etc/globus-gram-job-manager.conf#

This configuration file is used to construct the command-line options for the `globus-job-manager` program. Thus, all of the options described in link:#globus_job_manager_8[`globus-job-manager`] may be used.

==== Job Manager Logging
From an administrator's perspective, the most important job manager configuration options are likely the ones related to logging and auditing. The default GRAM5 configuration puts logs in [output]#/var/log/globus/gram_USERNAME.log#, with logging enabled at the `FATAL` and `ERROR` levels. To enable more fine-grained logging, add the option `-log-levels` ' to [output]#/etc/globus/globus-gram-job-manager#.conf. The value for . The value for 'LEVELS is a set of log levels joined by the | character. The available log levels are:

.GRAM5 Log Levels
[cols="3*<",options="header"]
|========
|Level	|Meaning	|Default Behavior
|`FATAL`	|Problems which cause the job manager to terminate prematurely.	|Enabled
|`ERROR`	|Problems which cause a job or operation to fail.	|Enabled
|`WARN`	|Problems which cause minor problems with job execution or monitoring.	|Disabled
|`INFO`	|Major events in the lifetime of the job manager and its jobs.	|Disabled
|`DEBUG`	|Minor events in the lifetime of jobs.	|Disabled
|`TRACE`	|Job processing details.	|Disabled
|========

In RPM or Debian package installs, these logs will be configured to be rotated via `logrotate`. See [output]#/etc/logrotate.d/globus-job-manager# for details on the default log rotation configuration.

==== Firewall Configuration

There are also a few configuration options related to the TCP ports the the Job Manager users. This port configuration is useful when dealing with firewalls that restrict incoming or outgoing ports. To restrict incoming ports (those that the Job Manager listens on), add the command-line option `-globus-tcp-port-range` to the Job Manager configuration file like this:

----
-globus-tcp-port-range MIN-PORT,MAX-PORT
----

Where _MIN-PORT_ is the minimum TCP port number the Job Manager will listen on and _MAX-PORT_ is the maximum TCP port number the Job Manager will listen on.

Similarly, to restrict the outgoing port numbers that the job manager connects form, use the command-line option `-globus-tcp-source-range`, like this:

----
-globus-tcp-source-range MIN-PORT,MAX-PORT
----

Where _MIN-PORT_ is the minimum outgoing TCP port number the Job Manager will use and _MAX-PORT_ is the maximum TCP outgoing port number the Job Manager will use.

For more information about Globus and firewalls, see link:../../installation#firewall_configuration[Firewall configuration].

=== LRM Adapter Configuration
Each LRM adapter has its own configuration file which can help customize the adapter to the site configuration. Some LRMs use non-standard programs to launch parallel or MPI jobs, and some might want to provide queue or project validation to make it easier to translate job failures into problems that can be described by GRAM5. All of the LRM adapter configuration files consist of simple `variable="value"` pairs, with a leading # starting a comment until end-of-line.

Generally, the GRAM5 LRM configuration files are located in the globus configuration directory, with each configuration file named by the LRM name (`fork`, `condor`, `pbs`, `sge`, or `slurm`). The following are the paths to these configurations:

RPM Package::
[file]#/etc/globus/globus-_LRM_.conf#
Debian Package::
[file]#etc/globus/globus-_LRM_.conf:#
Source Installer::
[file]#_PREFIX_/etc/globus/globus-_LRM_.conf#

==== Fork

The [file]#globus-fork.conf# configuration file can define the following configuration parameters:

log_path::
Path to the [file]#globus-fork.log# file used by the file used by the `globus-fork-starter` and fork SEG module.
mpiexec, mpirun::
Path to `mpiexec` and `mpirun` for parallel jobs which use MPI. By default, these are not configured. The LRM adapter will use `mpiexec` over `mpirun` if both are defined.
softenv_dir::
Path to an installation of link:http://www.mcs.anl.gov/hs/software/systems/softenv/softenv-intro.html[softenv], which is used on some systems to manage application environment variables.

==== Condor

The [file]#globus-condor.conf# configuration file can define the following configuration parameters:

condor_os::
Custom value for the OpSys requirement for condor jobs. If not specified, the system-wide default will be used.
condor_arch::
Custom value for the OpSys requirement for condor jobs. If not specified, the system-wide default will be used.
condor_submit, condor_rm::
Path to the condor commands that the LRM adapter uses. These are usually determined when the LRM adapter is compiled if the commands are in the [output]#PATH#.
condor_config::
Value of the `CONDOR_CONFIG` environment variable, which might be needed to use condor in some cases.
check_vanilla_files::
Enable checking if executable, standard input, and directory are valid paths for [file]#vanilla# universe jobs. This can detect some types of errors before submitting jobs to condor, but only if the filesystems between the condor submit host and condor execution hosts are equivalent. In other cases, this may cause unneccessary job failures.
condor_mpi_script::
Path to a script to launch MPI jobs on condor

==== PBS

The [file]#globus-pbs.conf# configuration file can define the following configuration parameters:

log_path::
Path to PBS server_logs directory. The PBS SEG module parses these logs to generate LRM events.
pbs_default::
Name of the PBS server node, if not the same as the GRAM service node.
mpiexec, mpirun::
Path to mpiexec and `mpirun` for parallel jobs which use MPI. By default these are not configured. The LRM adapter will use `mpiexec` over `mpirun` if both are defined.
qsub, qstat, qdel::
Path to the LRM-specific command to submit, check, and delete PBS jobs. These are usually determined when the LRM adapter is compiled if they are in the PATH.
cluster::
If this value is set to yes, then the LRM adapter will attempt to use a remote shell command to launch multiple instances of the executable on different nodes, as defined by the file named by the `PBS_NODEFILE` environment variable.
remote_shell::
Remote shell command to launch processes on different nodes when cluster is set to yes.
cpu_per_node::
Number of instances of the executable to launch per allocated node.
softenv_dir::
Path to an installation of link:http://www.mcs.anl.gov/hs/software/systems/softenv/softenv-intro.html[softenv] which is used on some systems to manage application environment variables.

==== SGE

The [file]#globus-sge.conf# configuration file can define the following configuration parameters:

sge_root::
Root location of the GridEngine installation. If this is set to [output]#undefined#, then the LRM adapter will try to determine it from the `globus-job-manager` environment, or if not there, the contents of the file named by the `sge_config` configuration parameter.
sge_cell::
Name of the GridEngine cell to interact with. If this is set to [output]#undefined#, then the LRM adapter will try to determine it from the `globus-job-manager` environment, or if not there, the contents of the file named by the `sge_config` configuration parameter.
sge_config::
Path to a file which defines the `SGE_ROOT` and the `SGE_CELL` environment variables.
log_path::
Path to GridEngine reporting file. This value is used by the SGE SEG module. If this is used, GridEngine must be configured to write a reporting file and not load reporting data into an ARCo database.

sun_mprun, mpirun::
Path to `mprun` and `mpirun` for parallel jobs which use MPI. By default these are not configured. The LRM adapter will use `mprun` over `mpirun` if both are defined.
default_pe::
Default parallel environment to submit parallel jobs to. If this is not set, then clients must use the [file]#parallel_environment# RSL attribute to choose one.
validate_pes::
If this value is set to yes, then the LRM adapter will verify that the [file]#parallel_environment# RSL attribute value matches one of the parallel environments supported by this GridEngine service.
available_pes::
If this value is defined, use it as a list of parallel environments supported by this GridEngine deployment for validation when [file]#validate_pes# is set to [file]#yes#. If validation is being done but this value is not set, then the LRM adapter will query the GridEngine service to determine available parallel environments at startup.
default_queue::
Default queue to use if the job description does not name one.
validate_queues::
If this value is set to yes, then the LRM adapter will verify that the queue RSL attribute value matches one of the queues supported by this GridEngine service.
available_queues::
If this value is defined, use it as a list of queues supported by this GridEngine deployment for validation when [file]#validate_queues# is set to [file]#yes#. If validation is being done but this value is not set, then the LRM adapter will query the GridEngine service to determine available queues at startup.

===== Enabling reporting for the GridEngine Scheduler Event Generator

In order to use the Scheduler Event Generator with GridEngine, the job reporting feature must be enabled, and ARCo database storage must not be enabled. To enable this, use the command `qconf -mconf` and modify the [output]#reporting_params# parameter so that the options [output]#reporting# and [output]#joblog# are set to [output]#true#.

=== Auditing
The `globus-gram-audit` configuration defines information about the database to load the GRAM5 audit records into. This configuration is located in:

RPM Package::
[file]#/etc/globus/gram-audit.conf#
Debian Package::
[file]#/etc/globus/gram-audit.conf#
Source Installer::
[file]#PREFIX/etc/globus/gram-audit.conf#

This configuration file contains the following attributes. Each attribute is defined by a [file]#ATTRIBUTE:VALUE# pair.

=== RSL Attributes
GRAM5 uses the RSL language to encode job descriptions. The attributes supported by gram are defined in RSL Validation Files. These definitions contain information about when the different RSL attributes are valid and what their default values might be if not present. GRAM5 will look in [file]#/etc/globus/gram/job-manager.rvf# and and [file]#/etc/globus/gram/LRM.rvf# for site-specfic changes to the RSL validation file. for site-specfic changes to the RSL validation file.

== Audit Logging
=== Overview
GRAM5 includes mechanisms to provide access to audit and accounting information associated with jobs that GRAM5 submits to a local resource manager (LRM) such as Torque, GridEngine, or Condor.

In some scenarios, it is desirable to get general information about the usage of the underlying LRM, such as:

- What kinds of jobs were submitted via GRAM?
- How long did the processing of a job take?
- How many jobs were submitted by user X?

The following three use cases give a better overview of the meaning and purpose of auditing and accounting:

1. *Group Access:* A grid resource provider allows a remote service (e.g., a gateway or portal) to submit jobs on behalf of multiple users. The grid resource provider only obtains information about the identity of the remote submitting service and thus does not know the identity of the users for which the grid jobs are submitted. This group access is allowed under the condition that the remote service stores audit information so that, if and when needed, the grid resource provider can request and obtain information to track a specific job back to an individual user.
2. *Query Job Accounting:* A client that submits a job needs to be able to obtain, after the job has completed, information about the resources consumed by that job. In portal and gateway environments where many users submit many jobs against a single allocation, this per-job accounting information is needed soon after the job completes so that client-side accounting can be updated. Accounting information is sensitive and thus should only be released to authorized parties.
3. *Auditing:* In a distributed, multi-site environment, it can be necessary to investigate various forms of suspected intrusion and abuse. In such cases, we may need to access an audit trail of the actions performed by a service. When accessing this audit trail, it will frequently be important to be able to relate specific actions to the user.

Audit logging in GRAM5 is done when a job completes.

=== Audit and Accounting Records
While audit and accounting records may be generated and stored by different entities in different contexts, we make the following assumptions in this chapter:

[cols="3*<",options="header"]
|========
|	|Audit Records	|Accounting Records
|Generated by:	|GRAM service	|LRM to which the GRAM service submits jobs
|Stored in:	|Database, indexed by GJID	|LRM, indexed by JID
|Data that is stored:	|See list below.	|May include all information about the duration and resource-usage of a job
|========

The audit record of each job contains the following data:

- `job_grid_id`: String representation of the resource EPR
- `local_job_id`: Job/process id generated by the scheduler
- `subject_name`: Distinguished name (DN) of the user
- `username`: Local username
- `idempotence_id`: Job id generated on the client-side
- `creation_time`: Date when the job resource is created
- `queued_time`: Date when the job is submitted to the scheduler
- `stage_in_grid_id`: String representation of the stageIn-EPR (RFT)
- `stage_out_grid_id`: String representation of the stageOut-EPR (RFT)
- `clean_up_grid_id`: String representation of the cleanUp-EPR (RFT)
- `globus_toolkit_version`: Version of the server-side GT
- `resource_manager_type`: Type of the resource manager (Fork, Condor, ...)
- `job_description`: Complete job description document
- `success_flag`: Flag that shows whether the job failed or finished successfully
- `finished_flag`: Flag that shows whether the job is already fully processed or still in progress
- `gateway_user`: Teragrid identity of the user which submitted the job.

=== For More Information
The rest of this chapter focuses on how to configure GRAM5 to enable Audit-Logging.

Audit logging is turned off by default. To enable GRAM5 audit logging, in the job manager, add the command-line option `-audit-directory` to the job manager configuration in one of the following locations:

[file]#$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-job-manager.conf# to enable it for all job manager services to enable it for all job manager services
[file]#$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/grid-services/LRM_SERVICE_NAME# to enable it for a particular job manager service for a particular LRM. to enable it for a particular job manager service for a particular LRM.

=== Audit Database Interface
The `globus-gram-audit` program reads GRAM5 audit records and loads those records into a SQL database. This program is available as part of the `globus_gram_job_manager_auditing` package. It must be configured by installing and running the `globus_gram_job_manager_auditing_setup_scripts` setup package via gpt-postinstall. This setup script creates the [file]#$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-job-manager-audit.conf# configuration file described below and creates database tables needed by the audit system.

The `globus-gram-audit` program support three database systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

== Security Considerations

=== Gatekeeper Security Considerations

GRAM5 runs different parts of itself under different privilege levels. The `globus-gatekeeper` runs as root, and uses its root privilege to access the host's private key. It uses the grid map file to map Grid Certificates to local user ids and then uses the `setuid()` function to change to that user and execute the `globus-job-manager program`.

=== Job Manager Security Considerations

The `globus-job-manager` program runs as a local non-root account. It receives a delegated limited proxy certificate from the GRAM5 client which it uses to access Grid storage resources via GridFTP and to authenticate job signals (such as client cancel requests), and send job state callbacks to registered clients. This proxy is generally short-lived, and is automatically removed by the job manager when the job completes.

The `globus-job-manager` program uses a publicly-writable directory for job state files. This directory has the *sticky* bit set, so users may not remove other users files. Each file is named by a UUID, so it should be unique.

=== Fork SEG Module Security Considerations

The Fork Scheduler Event Generator module uses a globally writable file for job state change events. This is not recommended for production use.

== Troubleshooting
=== Admin Troubleshooting
==== Security
GRAM requires a host certificate and private key in order for the `globus-gatekeeeper` service to run. These are typically located in [file]#/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem# and [file]#/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem#, but the path is configurable in the , but the path is configurable in the link:#gatekeeper_configuration[gatekeeper configuration file]. The key must be protected by file permissions allowing only the root user to read it.

GRAM also (by default) uses a [file]#grid-mapfile# to authorize Grid users as local users. This file is typically located in to authorize Grid users as local users. This file is typically located in [file]#/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile#, but is configurable in the , but is configurable in the link:#gatekeeper_configuration[gatekeeper configuration file].

Problems in either of these configurations will show up in the gatekeeper log described below. See the GSI documentation for more detailed information about obtaining and installing host certificates and maintaining a [file]#grid-mapfile#.

==== Verify that Services are Running

GRAM relies on the `globus-gatekeeper` program and (in some cases) the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` programs to process jobs. If the former is not running, jobs requests will fail with a "connection refused" error. If the latter is not running, GRAM jobs will appear to "hang" in the [output]#PENDING# state.

The `globus-gatekeeper` is typically started via an init script installed in [file]#/etc/init.d/globus-gatekeeper#. The command `/etc/init.d/globus-gatekeeper` status will indicate whether the service is running. See link:#starting_and_stopping_gram5_services[Starting and Stopping GRAM5 services] for more information about starting and stopping the `globus-gatekeeper` program.

If the `globus-gatekeeper` service fails to start, the output of the command `globus-gatekeeper -test` will output information describing some types of configuration problems.

The `globus-scheduler-event-generator` is typically started via an init script installed in [file]#/etc/init.d/globus-scheduler-event-generator#. It is only needed when the LRM-specific "setup-seg" package is installed. The command . It is only needed when the LRM-specific "setup-seg" package is installed. The command `/etc/init.d/globus-scheduler-event-generator status` will indicate whether the service is running. See link:#starting_and_stopping_gram5_services[Starting and Stopping GRAM5 services] for more information about starting and stopping the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` program.

==== Verify that LRM packages are installed

The `globus-gatekeeper` program starts the `globus-job-manager` service with different command-line parameters depending on the LRM being used. Use the command `globus-gatekeeper-admin -l` to list which LRMs the gatekeeper is configured to use.

The `globus-job-manager-script.pl` is the interface between the GRAM job manager process and the LRM adapter. The command `/usr/share/globus/globus-job-manager-script.pl -h` will print the list of available adapters.

----terminal
%  /usr/share/globus/globus-job-manager-script.pl -h
[output]#USAGE: /usr/share/globus/globus-job-manager-script.pl -m MANAGER -f FILE -c COMMAND
Installed managers: condor fork#
----terminal

The `globus-scheduler-event-generator` also uses an LRM-specific module to generate scheduler events for GRAM to reduce the amount of resources GRAM uses on the machine where it runs. To determine which LRMs are installed and configured, use the command `globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin -l`.

----terminal
%  globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin -l
[output]#fork [DISABLED]#
----terminal

If any of these do not show the LRM you are trying to use, install the relevant packages related to that LRM and restart the GRAM services. See the link:#[GRAM Administrator's Guide] for more information about starting and stopping the GRAM services.

==== Verify that the LRM packages are configured

All GRAM5 LRM adapters have a configuration file for site customizations, such as queue names, paths to executables needed to interface with the LRM, etc. Check that the values in these files are correct. These files are described in link:#lrm_adapter_configuration[LRM Adapter Configuration].

==== Check the Gatekeeper Log

The [file]#/var/log/globus-gatekeeper.log# file contains information about service requests from clients, and will be useful when diagnosing service startup failures, authentication failures, and authorization failures.

===== Authorization failures

GRAM uses GSI to authenticate client job requests. If there is a problem with the GSI configuration for your host, or a client is trying to connect with a certificate signed by a CA your host does not trust, the job request will fail. This will show up in the log as a "GSS authentication failure". See the link:../../gsi/admin[GSI Administrator's Guide] for information about diagnosing authentication failures.

===== Gridmap failures

After authentication is complete, GRAM maps the Grid identity to a local user prior to starting the `globus-job-manager` process. If this fails, an error will show up in the log as "globus_gss_assist_gridmap() failed authorization". See the link:../../gsi/admin[GSI Administrator's Guide] for information about managing gridmap files.

==== Job Manager Logs

A per-user job manager log is typically located in [file]#/var/log/globus/gram_$USERNAME.log#. This log contains information from the job manager as it attempts to execute GRAM jobs via a local resource manager. The logs can be fairly verbose. Sometimes looking for log entries near those containing the string . This log contains information from the job manager as it attempts to execute GRAM jobs via a local resource manager. The logs can be fairly verbose. Sometimes looking for log entries near those containing the string [output]#level=ERROR# will show more information about what caused a particular failure.

Once you've found an error in the log, it is generally useful to find log entries related to the job which hit that error. There are two job IDs associated with each job, one a GRAM-specific ID, and one an LRM-specific ID. To determine the GRAM ID associated with a job, look for the attribute [file]#gramid# in the log message. Finding that, looking for all other log messages which contain that [file]#gramid# value will give a better picture of what the job manager is doing. To determine the LRM-specific ID, look for a message at [output]#TRACE# level with the matching GRAM ID found above with the response value matching [file]#GRAM_SCRIPT_JOB_ID:LRM-ID#. You can then find follow the state of the _LRM-ID_ as well as the GRAM ID in the log, and correlate the _LRM-ID_ information with local resource manager logs and administrative tools.

==== Email Support

If all else fails, please send information about your problem to gram-user@globus.org. You'll have to subscribe to a list before you can send an e-mail to it. See link:https://globus.org/mailing-lists[here] for general e-mail lists and information on how to subscribe to a list and here for GRAM-specific lists. Depending on the problem, you may be requested to file a bug report to the Globus project's Issue Tracker.

=== GLOBUS-GATEKEEPER(8)
==== NAME

globus-gatekeeper - Authorize and execute a grid service on behalf of a user

==== SYNOPSIS

`globus-gatekeeper` [monospace]#[-help ] [-conf _PARAMETER_FILE_] [-test ] -d | -debug -inetd | -f -p _PORT_ | -port _PORT_ [-home _PATH_] -l _LOGFILE_ | -logfile _LOGFILE_ [-lf _LOG_FACILITY_] [-acctfile _ACCTFILE_] [-e _LIBEXECDIR_] [-launch_method fork_and_exit | fork_and_wait | dont_fork ] [-grid_services _SERVICEDIR_] [-globusid _GLOBUSID_] [-gridmap _GRIDMAP_] [-x509_cert_dir _TRUSTED_CERT_DIR_] [-x509_cert_file _TRUSTED_CERT_FILE_] [-x509_user_cert _CERT_PATH_] [-x509_user_key _KEY_PATH_] [-x509_user_proxy _PROXY_PATH_] [-k ] [-globuskmap _KMAP_] [-pidfile _PIDFILE_]#

==== Description

The `globus-gatekeeper` program is a meta-server similar to inetd or xinetd that starts other services after authenticating a TCP connection using GSSAPI and mapping the client's credential to a local account.

The most common use for the `globus-gatekeeper` program is to start instances of the [monospace]#globus-job-manager(8)# service. A single `globus-gatekeeper` deployment can handle multiple different service configurations by having entries in the [file]#/etc/grid-services# directory.

Typically, users interact with the `globus-gatekeeper` program via client applications such as [monospace]#globusrun(1)#, `globus-job-submit`, or tools such as CoG jglobus or Condor-G.

The full set of command-line options to `globus-gatekeeper` consists of:

`-help`::
Display a help message to standard error and exit
+-conf _PARAMETER_FILE_+::
Load configuration parameters from _PARAMETER_FILE_. The parameters in that file are treated as additional command-line options.
`-test`::
Parse the configuration file and print out the POSIX user id of the `globus-gatekeeper` process, service home directory, service execution directory, and X.509 subject name and then exits.
`-d`, `-debug`::
Run the `globus-gatekeeper` process in the foreground.
`-inetd`::
Flag to indicate that the `globus-gatekeeper` process was started via inetd or a similar super-server. If this flag is set and the `globus-gatekeeper` was not started via `inetd`, a warning will be printed in the gatekeeper log.
`-f`::
Flag to indicate that the `globus-gatekeeper` process should run in the foreground. This flag has no effect when the `globus-gatekeeper` is started via inetd.
+-p _PORT_+, +-port _PORT_+::
Listen for connections on the TCP/IP port _PORT_. This option has no effect if the `globus-gatekeeper` is started via inetd or a similar service. If not specified and the gatekeeper is running as root, the default of [monospace]#2119# is used. Otherwise, the gatekeeper defaults to an ephemeral port.
+-home _PATH_+::
Sets the gatekeeper deployment directory to _PATH_. This is used to interpret relative paths for accounting files, libexecdir, certificate paths, and also to set the _GLOBUS_LOCATION_ environment variable in the service environment. If not specified, the gatekeeper looks for service executables in [file]#/usr/sbin#, configuration in [file]#/etc#, and writes logs and accounting files to [file]#/var/log#.
+-l _LOGFILE_+, +-logfile _LOGFILE_+::
Write log entries to _LOGFILE_. If _LOGFILE_ is equal to logoff or [monospace]#LOGOFF#, then logging will be disabled, both to file and to syslog.
+-lf _LOG_FACILITY_+::
Open syslog using the _LOG_FACILITY_. If not specified, [monospace]#LOG_DAEMON# will be used as the default when using syslog.
+-acctfile _ACCTFILE_+::
Set the path to write accounting records to _ACCTFILE_. If not set, records will be written to the log file.
+-e _LIBEXECDIR_+::
Look for service executables in _LIBEXECDIR_. If not specified, the [file]#sbin# subdirectory of the parameter to subdirectory of the parameter to +-_home_+ is used, or [file]#/usr/sbin# if that is not set.
`-launch_method` [monospace]#fork_and_exit|fork_and_wait|dont_fork#::
Determine how to launch services. The method may be either [monospace]#fork_and_exit# (the service runs completely independently of the gatekeeper, which exits after creating the new service process), but the gatekeeper does not exit until the service terminates), or [monospace]#dont_fork#, where the gatekeeper process becomes the service process via the `exec()` system call.
+-grid_services _SERVICEDIR_+::
Look for service descriptions in _SERVICEDIR_.
+-globusid _GLOBUSID_+::
Sets the _GLOBUSID_ environment variable to _GLOBUSID_. This variable is used to construct the gatekeeper contact string if it can not be parsed from the service credential.
+-gridmap _GRIDMAP_+::
Use the file at _GRIDMAP_ to map GSSAPI names to POSIX user names.
+-x509_cert_dir _TRUSTED_CERT_DIR_+::
Use the directory _TRUSTED_CERT_DIR_ to locate trusted CA X.509 certificates. The gatekeeper sets the environment variable [monospace]#X509_CERT_DIR# to this value.
+-x509_user_cert _CERT_PATH_+::
Read the service X.509 certificate from _CERT_PATH_. The gatekeeper sets the [monospace]#X509_USER_CERT# environment variable to this value.
+-x509_user_key _KEY_PATH_+::
Read the private key for the service from _KEY_PATH_. The gatekeeper sets the [monospace]#X509_USER_KEY# environment variable to this value.
+-x509_user_proxy _PROXY_PATH_+::
Read the X.509 proxy certificate from _PROXY_PATH_. The gatekeeper sets the [monospace]#X509_USER_PROXY# environment variable to this value.
`-k`::
Use the `globus-k5` command to acquire Kerberos 5 credentials before starting the service.
+-globuskmap _KMAP_+::
Use _KMAP_ as the path to the Grid credential to kerberos initialization mapping file.
+-pidfile _PIDFILE_+::
Write the process id of the `globus-gatekeeper` to the file named by _PIDFILE_.

==== ENVIRONMENT

=== GLOBUS-GATEKEEPER-ADMIN(8)
==== NAME

`globus-gatekeeper-admin` - Manage globus-gatekeeper services

==== SYNOPSIS

`globus-gatekeeper-admin` [monospace]#[-h ]#

==== Description

The `globus-gatekeeper-admin` program manages service entries which are used by the `globus-gatekeeper` to execute services. Service entries are located in the [file]#/etc/grid-services# directory. The `globus-gatekeeper-admin` can list, enable, or disable specific services, or set a service as the default. The [monospace]#-h# command-line option shows a brief usage message.

===== Listing services

The [monospace]#-l# command-line option to `globus-gatekeeper-admin` will cause it to list all of the services which are available to be run by the `globus-gatekeeper`. In the output, the service name will be followed by its status in brackets. Possible status strings are [monospace]#ENABLED#, [monospace]#DISABLED#, and [monospace]#ALIAS# to , where _NAME_ is another service name.

If the [monospace]#-n# is used, then only information about the service named _NAME_ is printed.

===== Enabling services

The [monospace]#-e# command-line option to `globus-gatekeeper-admin` will cause it to enable a service so that it may be run by the `globus-gatekeeper`.

If the [monospace]#-n# option is used as well, then the service will be enabled with the alias _NAME_.

===== Enabling a default service

The [monospace]#-E# command-line option to `globus-gatekeeper-admin` will cause it to enable a service alias with the name [monospace]#jobmanager#. The `globus-gatekeeper-admin` program will choose the first service it finds as the default. To enable a particular service as the default, use the [monospace]#-e# parameter described above with the [monospace]#-n# parameter.

===== Disabling services

The [monospace]#-d# command-line option to `globus-gatekeeper-admin` will cause it to disable a service so that it may not be run by the `globus-gatekeeper`. All aliases to a disabled service are also disabled.

=== GLOBUS-GRAM-AUDIT(8)
==== NAME

`globus-gram-audit` - Load GRAM4 and GRAM5 audit records into a database

==== SYNOPSIS

`globus-gram-audit` [monospace]#[--conf _CONFIG_FILE_] [--create ] | [--update= _OLD-VERSION_] [--check ] [--delete ] [--audit-directory _AUDITDIR_] [--quiet ]#

==== Description

The `globus-gram-audit` program loads audit records to an SQL-based database. It reads [file]#$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-job-manager.conf# by default to determine the audit directory and then uploads all files in that directory that contain valid audit records to the database configured by the by default to determine the audit directory and then uploads all files in that directory that contain valid audit records to the database configured by the `globus_gram_job_manager_auditing_setup_scripts` package. If the upload completes successfully, the audit files will be removed.

The full set of command-line options to `globus-gram-audit` consist of:

+--conf _CONFIG_FILE_+::
Use _CONFIG_FILE_ instead of the default from the configuration file for audit database configuration.
+--check+::
Check whether the insertion of a record was successful by querying the database after inserting the records. This is used in tests.
+--delete+::
Delete audit records from the database right after inserting them. This is used in tests to avoid filling the databse with test records.
+--audit-directory _DIR_+::
Look for audit records in _DIR_, instead of looking in the directory specified in the job manager configuration. This is used in tests to control which records are loaded to the database and then deleted.
+--query _SQL_+::
Perform the given SQL query on the audit database. This uses the database information from the configuration file to determine how to contact the database.
+--quiet+
Reduce the amount of output for common operations.

==== Description

The `globus-job-manager` program is a servivce which starts and controls GRAM jobs which are executed by a local resource management system, such as LSF or Condor. The `globus-job-manager` program is typically started by the `globus-gatekeeper` program and not directly by a user. It runs until all jobs it is managing have terminated or its delegated credentials have expired.

Typically, users interact with the `globus-job-manager` program via client applications such as `globusrun`, `globus-job-submit`, or tools such as CoG jglobus or Condor-G.

+-history _HISTORY_DIRECTORY_+::
Configure the job manager to write job history files to _HISTORY_DIRECTORY_. These files are described in the FILES section below.
+-scratch-dir-base _SCRATCH_DIRECTORY_+::
Configure the job manager to use _SCRATCH_DIRECTORY_ as the default scratch directory root if a relative path is specified in the job RSL's [monospace]#scratch_dir# attribute.
+-enable-syslog+::
Configure the job manager to write log messages via syslog. Logging is further controlled by the argument to the [monospace]#-log-levels# parameter described below.
+-log-pattern _PATTERN_+::
Configure the job manager to write log messages to files named by the string _PATTERN_. The _PATTERN_ string may contain job-independent RSL substitutions such as [monospace]#$(HOME)#, [monospace]#$(LOGNAME)#, etc, as well as the special RSL substition [monospace]#$(DATE)# which will be resolved at log time to the date in YYYYMMDD form.
+-stdio-log _LOG_DIRECTORY_+::

This directory must be writable by all users and be on a file system which supports POSIX advisory file locks.
+-globus-tcp-port-range _PORT_RANGE_+::
Configure the job manager to restrict its TCP/IP communication to use ports in the range described by _PORT_RANGE_. This value is also made available in the job environment via the [monospace]#GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE# environment variable.
+-globus-tcp-source-range _SOURCE_RANGE_+::
Configure the job manager to restrict its TCP/IP communication to use source ports in the range described by _SOURCE_RANGE_. This value is also made available in the job environment via the [monospace]#GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE# environment variable.
+-x509-cert-dir _TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_DIRECTORY_+::
Configure the job manager to search _TRUSTED_CERTIFICATE_DIRECTORY_ for its list of trusted CA certificates and their signing policies. This value is also made available in the job environment via the [monospace]#X509_CERT_DIR# environment variable.
+-cache-location _GASS_CACHE_DIRECTORY_+::
Configure the job manager to use the path _GASS_CACHE_DIRECTORY_ for its temporary GASS-cache files. This value is also made available in the job environment via the [monospace]#GLOBUS_GASS_CACHE_DEFAULT# environment variable.
+-k+::
Configure the job manager to assume it is using Kerberos for authentication instead of X.509 certificates. This disables some certificate-specific processing in the job manager.
+-extra-envvars _VAR=VAL_,...+::
Configure the job manager to define a set of environment variables in the job environment beyond those defined in the base job environment. The format of the parameter to this argument is a comma-separated sequence of _VAR=VAL_ pairs, where [monospace]#VAR# is the variable name and [monospace]#VAL# is the variable's value. If the value is not specified, then the value of the variable in the job manager's environment is used. This option may be present multiple times on the command-line or the job manager configuration file to append multiple environment settings.
+-seg-module _SEG_MODULE_+::
Configure the job manager to use the schedule event generator module named by _SEG_MODULE_ to detect job state changes events from the local resource manager, in place of the less efficient polling operations used in GT2. To use this, one instance of the `globus-job-manager-event-generator` must be running to process events for the LRM into a generic format that the job manager can parse.
+-audit-directory _AUDIT_DIRECTORY_+::
Configure the job manager to write audit records to the directory named by _AUDIT_DIRECTORY_. This records can be loaded into a database using the `globus-gram-audit` program.
+-globus-toolkit-version _TOOLKIT_VERSION_+::
Configure the job manager to use _TOOLKIT_VERSION_ as the version for audit and usage stats records.
+-service-tag _SERVICE_TAG_+::
Configure the job manager to use _SERVICE_TAG_ as a unique identifier to allow multiple GRAM instances to use the same job state directories without interfering with each other's jobs. If not set, the value untagged will be used.
+-disable-streaming+::
Configure the job manager to disable file streaming. This is propagated to the LRM script interface but has no effect in GRAM5.
+-disable-usagestats+::
Disable sending of any usage stats data, even if _-usagestats-targets_ is present in the configuration.
+-usagestats-targets _TARGET_+::
Send usage packets to a data collection service for analysis. The _TARGET_ string consists of a comma-separated list of HOST:PORT combinations, each contaiing an optional list of data to send. Special tag strings of all (which enables all tags) and default may be used, or a sequence of characters for the various tags.

=== GLOBUS-RVF-CHECK(8)
==== NAME

`globus-rvf-check` - Edit a GRAM5 RSL validation file

==== SYNOPSIS

`globus-rvf-check` [monospace]#[-h ] [-help ]#

==== Description

The `globus-rvf-check` command is a utility which checks the syntax of a RSL validation file, and prints out parse errors when encountered. It can also parse the RVF file contents and then dump file's contents to stdout, after canonicalizing values and quoting. The exit code of `globus-rvf-check` is [output]#0# if all files specified on the command line exist and have no parse errors.

The full set of command-line options to `globus-rvf-check` consists of:

+-h, -help, --help+::
Print command-line option summary and exit
+-d+::
Dump the RVF contents to stdout. In the output, Each file which is parsed will be prefixed by an RVF comment which contains the input filename. If not specified, `globus-rvf-check` just prints a diagnostic message to standard output indicating whether the file could be parsed.

=== GLOBUS-RVF-EDIT(8)
==== NAME

`globus-rvf-edit` - Edit a GRAM5 RSL validation file

==== SYNOPSIS

`globus-rvf-edit` [monospace]#[-h ]#

==== Description

The `globus-rvf-edit` command is a utility which opens the default editor on a specified RSL validation file, and then, when editing completes, runs the `globus-rvf-check` command to verify that the RVF file syntax is correct. If a parse error occurs, the user will be given an option to rerun the editor or discard the modifications.

The full set of command-line options to `globus-rvf-edit` consists of:

+-h+::
Print command-line option summary and exit
+-s+::
Edit of the site-specific RVF file, which provides override values applicable to all LRMs installed on the system.
+-l _LRM_+::
Edit the site-specific _LRM_ overrides for the LRM named by the _LRM_ parameter to the option.
+-f _PATH_+::
Edit the RVF file located at _PATH_

=== GLOBUS-SCHEDULER-EVENT-GENERATOR(8)
==== NAME

`globus-scheduler-event-generator` - Process LRM events into a common format for use with GRAM

==== SYNOPSIS

`globus-scheduler-event-generator` [monospace]#-s _LRM_ [-t _TIMESTAMP_] [-d _DIRECTORY_] [-b ] [-p _PIDFILE_]#

==== Description

The `globus-scheduler-event-generator` program processes information from a local resource manager to generate LRM-independent events which GRAM can use to track job state changes. Typically, the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` is started at system boot time for all LRM adapters which have been installed. The only required parameter to `globus-scheduler-event-generator` is [monospace]#-s#, which indicates what LRM-specific module to load. A list of available modules can be found by using the `globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin` command.

Other options control how the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` program runs and where its output goes. These options are:

+-t _TIMESTAMP_+::
Start processing events which start at _TIMESTAMP_ in seconds since the UNIX epoch. If not present, the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` will process events from the time it was started, and not look for historical events.
+-d _DIRECTORY_+::
Write the event log to files in _DIRECTORY_, instead of printing them to standard output. Within _DIRECTORY_, logs will be named by the time when they were created in YYYYMMDD format.
+-b+::
Run the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` program in the background.
+-p _PIDFILE_+::
Write the process-id of `globus-scheduler-event-generator` to _PIDFILE_.

=== GLOBUS-SCHEDULER-EVENT-GENERATOR-ADMIN(8)
==== NAME

`globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin` - Manage SEG modules

==== SYNOPSIS

`globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin` [monospace]#[-h ]#

==== Description

The `globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin` program manages SEG modules which are used by the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` to monitor a local resource manager or batch system for events. The `globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin` can list, enable, or disable specific SEG modules. The [monospace]#-h# command-line option shows a brief usage message.

===== Listing SEG Modules

The [monospace]#-l# command-line option to `globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin` will cause it to list all of the SEG modules which are available to be run by the `globus-scheduler-event-generator`. In the output, the service name will be followed by its status in brackets. Possible status strings are [monospace]#ENABLED# and [monospace]#DISABLED#.

===== Enabling SEG Modules

The [monospace]#-e# command-line option to `globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin` will cause it to enable the module so that the init script for the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` will run it.

===== Disabling SEG Modules

The [monospace]#-d# command-line option to `globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin` will cause it to disable the module so that it will not be started by the `globus-scheduler-event-generator` init script.
