[red]#(CONTENT NEEDS REVIEW)#

The Grid Resource Allocation and Management (GRAM5) component is used to locate, submit, monitor, and cancel jobs on Grid computing resources. GRAM5 is not a Local Resource Manager, but rather a set of services and clients for communicating with a range of different batch/cluster job schedulers using a common protocol. GRAM5 is meant to address a range of jobs where reliable operation, stateful monitoring, credential management, and file staging are important.

The following guides are available for this component:
