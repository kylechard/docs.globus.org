== Paragraphs

Paragraphs don't require any special markup in AsciiDoc.
A paragraph is just one or more lines of consecutive text.

To begin a new paragraph, separate it by at least one blank line.

=== Line breaks
Rubies are red, +
Topazes are blue.

=== hardbreaks (wouldn't compile; asciidoctor only)
// [%hardbreaks]
Ruby is red.
Java is black.

=== Literal
A normal paragraph.

 A sequence of lines that begin with at least one space is a literal paragraph.
 Literal paragraphs are treated as preformatted text.
 The text is shown in a fixed-width font
 and endlines are preserved.

Another normal paragraph.

=== Admonition
NOTE: An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to
auxiliary information.
Its purpose is determined by the label

==== Complex content in outline lists
* Every list item has at least one paragraph of content,
  which may be wrapped, even using a hanging indent.

Additional paragraphs or blocks are adjoined by putting

list continuation:: a plus sign (`{plus}`) on a line by itself

* A literal paragraph does not require a list continuation.

 $ gem install asciidoctor

* AsciiDoc lists may contain any complex content.
