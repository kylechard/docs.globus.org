*-s* 'SYNC-LEVEL'::

Synchronize, i.e. only copy new files or files that have been changed.  Note
that this option alone does not turn on deletion of any files.  (See the
*--delete* option for that).
+
Valid sync levels are:
+
*0*;;
Copy files that do not exist at the destination

*1*;;
Copy files if the size of the destination does not match the size of the
source 

*2*;;
Copy files if the timestamp of the destination is older than the timestamp of
the source

*3*;;
Copy files if checksums of the source and destination do not match

+
Each sync level includes the comparison criteria from lower-numbered levels.
For instance, if level 3 is specified and the source and destination file
sizes are different or the source file has a newer timestamp, the file will be
transfered and a checksum operation is not even attempted.
