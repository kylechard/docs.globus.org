= LABELS(7)

== NAME

labels - Task labeling

== DESCRIPTION

Globus Online tasks may be given a user created, arbitrary label to enable easy
categorization and management of lots of tasks.

Commands that create tasks, like *scp* and *rm*, accept a *--label*
option to initially set a label.  The *modify* command can set or change a
label of a previously created task, even if the task has already completed.

The *status* command can show a task's label and search tasks by label using
wildcarding.


=== Label Format

A label is opaque to Globus Online - no specific form is required, however only
certain characters are allowed.

A label may only contain these characters:

* ASCII upper and lower case letters
* The digits 0-9
* space (" ")
* hypen ("-")
* underscore ("_")
* comma (",")

The maximum label length is 128 characters.
